### I. The Architecture of Influence

The anti-ESG campaign in Montana is not a homegrown phenomenon but the direct result of a coordinated political strategy orchestrated by the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF) and its allies. This campaign, executed by key state officials including the State Auditor and Attorney General, leveraged a national playbook of political pressure and model legislation. The ultimate goal was achieved with the passage of legislation that redefined the fiduciary duties of public investment managers to serve a partisan agenda, creating a significant conflict with the traditional governance of the state's public pension funds.

### II. Key Actors: A Coordinated Executive Front

The SFOF network's agenda in Montana was implemented by a coordinated front of executive officials, creating a "pincer movement" of financial and legal pressure.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **James Brown**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Auditor</span> | **The Financial Conduit:** A documented SFOF member who serves as Commissioner of Securities and Insurance and sits on the Montana Board of Land Commissioners. | Provides the direct link between the national SFOF network and the state's financial regulatory and investment apparatus. |
| **Austin Knudsen**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Attorney General</span> | **The Legal Enforcer:** A national leader in the movement's legal assault on ESG. | Spearheaded a 16-state letter to BlackRock over its ESG policies; publicly denounced ESG as a "pernicious" threat to pensioners. |
| **Greg Gianforte**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Governor</span> | **The Executive Champion:** Aligned with the movement, providing top-level executive sanction for the agenda. | Announced the state would block "activist, woke capitalism through ESG investing" and signed the landmark anti-ESG bill, HB 228, into law. |

### III. The Campaign in Action: From Rhetoric to Law

#### Legislative Capture: The Passage of House Bill 228
The ultimate goal of the campaign was achieved in 2023 with the passage of **House Bill 228**. A textual analysis of the law reveals its direct lineage from the model policies of The Heritage Foundation. The law amends Montana's public investment statutes to impose a new, restrictive standard on fiduciaries, mandating that the board of investments "must take into account only pecuniary factors."

The law's power lies in its politically charged definitions, which narrowly define a "pecuniary factor" as something with a "material effect on the financial risk or financial return" while broadly defining a "nonpecuniary" interest to include "any purpose to further environmental, social, governance, or other similarly oriented considerations." This legally frames the SFOF worldview as the only legitimate basis for fiduciary action.

### IV. The Pension Funds Transformed: Impact on MPERA & TRS

The anti-ESG campaign has had a direct impact on the governance of the Montana Public Employee Retirement Administration (MPERA) and the Teachers' Retirement System (TRS) by altering the legal framework for the Montana Board of Investments (BOI), which manages the assets for both systems.

#### Subversion of Investment Policy by Statute
The pre-existing, apolitical Investment Policy Statement of the BOI has been effectively subverted by the new, binding statutory mandates of HB 228. The BOI is now legally constrained by the law's narrow, politically charged definitions, regardless of the text of its own governing document. This represents a legislative seizure of investment philosophy, imposing a political ideology from the outside.

#### The Proxy Voting Battlefield
HB 228 explicitly forbids the BOI from following the recommendations of any proxy advisory firm that does not commit, in writing, to adhere to Montana's new "pecuniary factors only" standard. This provision creates a direct conflict with mainstream advisors like ISS and Glass Lewis and is designed to neutralize shareholder engagement as a tool for corporate accountability on ESG-related issues.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign in Montana resolved the conflict between political action and legal duty by legislatively redefining the duty itself to align with a partisan agenda. The new law fundamentally alters and conflicts with the state's traditional "prudent expert principle."

> "The evaluation by the board of investments... **must take into account only pecuniary factors**."
>
> — Montana House Bill 228 (2023)

This new legal framework creates a "fiduciary trap." Under the traditional standard (Montana Code Annotated § 17-6-201), a trustee could be liable for failing to consider a material financial risk, like climate change. Under the new law, a trustee who does consider that same risk could be accused by the Attorney General of violating the "pecuniary factors only" rule. This inverts the purpose of fiduciary law, transforming it from a shield that protects beneficiaries into a sword that enforces a political agenda and may compel fiduciaries to act imprudently to avoid political reprisal.
