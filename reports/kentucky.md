### I. The SFOF-Kentucky Nexus: An Architecture of Influence

Kentucky serves as a critical "blueprint" state for the execution of the SFOF anti-ESG playbook. The relationship between the Commonwealth and SFOF is uniquely symbiotic, highlighted by the career of SFOF's current CEO, **Dr. OJ Oleka**, who previously served as Kentucky's Deputy Treasurer. This "revolving door" establishes a direct link between the national network and the state it has sought to influence, positioning Kentucky not just as a participant but as a crucial incubator for the movement's national leadership.

A coordinated "whole-of-government" approach, led by the Treasurer's and Attorney General's offices, successfully captured state financial policy to serve a national political agenda, culminating in the legislative redefinition of fiduciary duty itself.

### II. Key Actors: A Coordinated Executive Front

The anti-ESG campaign in Kentucky was executed through the parallel and mutually reinforcing actions of the state's top financial and legal officers, creating a powerful "pincer movement" of financial and legal pressure.

Serves as a KTRS Trustee. |

### III. The Campaign in Action: From Model to Law

#### Legislative Capture: The Enactment of House Bill 236
The ultimate goal of the campaign was achieved in 2023 with the passage of **House Bill 236**. The law amends the Kentucky Revised Statutes to impose a new, restrictive standard on all state pension fiduciaries. Its language is a near-verbatim adoption of The Heritage Foundation's model "State Pension Fiduciary Duty Act." The bill was signed into law by Democratic Governor Andy Beshear, who faced a veto-proof Republican supermajority, giving a veneer of bipartisan consensus to a deeply partisan bill.

The law's power lies in its politically charged definitions. It mandates that fiduciaries must act "using only pecuniary factors" and broadly defines a prohibited "nonpecuniary interest" to include any "environmental, social, political, or ideological interest" without a direct and material connection to financial risk or return.

#### Wielding Administrative Power: Divestment Threats
Prior to the law's passage, the campaign used administrative power to apply pressure. In January 2023, then-Treasurer Allison Ball invoked a 2022 "energy boycott" law to identify 11 major financial institutions, including BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase, for potential divestment. This action was publicly lauded by the Kentucky Coal Association, reinforcing the narrative that the Treasurer's actions were a necessary defense of the state's signature industries.

### IV. Impact on the Kentucky Retirement Systems (KRS)

The anti-ESG campaign has had tangible effects on the governance and policies of the KRS, which manages the retirement security of hundreds of thousands of public servants.

#### Subversion of Investment Policy by Statute
The passage of HB 236 effectively rewrote the foundational governing documents of the KRS by legislative fiat. The apolitical language of the KRS Investment Policy Statement, which is grounded in the traditional "Prudent Person Rule," is now legally superseded by the ideological mandates of the new statute. This represents a legislative seizure of investment philosophy, stripping the board of professional discretion.

#### The Proxy Voting Battlefield
HB 236 creates a functional "poison pill" for mainstream proxy advisors like ISS (whom KRS uses). The law now requires a separate, burdensome "economic analysis" for any vote recommendation that is inconsistent with a company's board. This is a strategic maneuver designed to neutralize shareholder engagement as a tool for corporate accountability, either by forcing KRS to hire a niche, anti-ESG firm or by compelling it to abstain from voting on contentious issues.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign in Kentucky resolved the potential conflict between politically motivated actions and the traditional standard of fiduciary duty by legislatively redefining the duty itself to align with a partisan agenda.

> "A determination of 'solely in the interest of the members and beneficiaries' shall be made... **using only pecuniary factors** and shall not include any purpose to further a **nonpecuniary interest**."
>
> â€” Kentucky House Bill 236 (2023)

This new legal framework creates a "fiduciary trap." Under the traditional prudent person rule, a fiduciary who ignored obvious, long-term climate risks could be sued for imprudence. The new law flips this liability. A fiduciary who now ignores those same climate risks can defend their actions by claiming they were focusing "only on pecuniary factors." Conversely, a fiduciary who does consider climate risk is now the one exposed to legal challenge for potentially considering a "nonpecuniary interest." The law weaponizes fiduciary duty to protect a specific industry and ideology by strategically manipulating the legal risk calculations of pension trustees.
