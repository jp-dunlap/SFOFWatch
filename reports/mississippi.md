### I. The Architecture of Influence

Mississippi serves as a crucial and complex case study in the SFOF network's national campaign. The state is not merely a follower of the anti-ESG trend but a central leadership hub, given the deep integration of its top executive officers within the SFOF network's leadership structure. This has facilitated a coordinated "whole-of-government" approach to implement a national agenda, creating a profound conflict between the political objectives of state officials and the established fiduciary duties governing the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi (PERS).

### II. Key Actors: A Leadership Hub

The anti-ESG campaign in Mississippi is driven by a coordinated front of the state's highest-ranking officials, who are not just members but architects of the national SFOF strategy.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **David McRae**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Treasurer</span> | **The Conduit:** A documented SFOF member and ex-officio voting member of the PERS Board of Trustees. | Prolific signatory on SFOF letters (opposing DEI, federal climate rules); publicly committed to investing in Israel Bonds, an SFOF sponsor. |
| **Lynn Fitch**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Attorney General</span> | **The Architect:** Served as SFOF National Chair while she was State Treasurer (2012-2020), helping to formulate the national anti-ESG strategy. | As a key architect of the national playbook, her current position as chief legal officer provides a powerful vector for its implementation. |
| **Shad White**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Auditor</span> | **The Enforcer:** A documented SFOF member, lending the authority of his office to the network's ideological campaigns. | Signed SFOF letters opposing corporate DEI policies and has publicly criticized "woke" spending of taxpayer funds. |
| **Michael Watson**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Secretary of State</span> | **The Tactical Innovator:** Not a documented SFOF member, but has used his office's regulatory power to execute the anti-ESG agenda. | Issued a cease-and-desist order against BlackRock for alleged securities fraud related to its ESG statements; opened investigations into proxy advisors ISS and Glass Lewis. |

### III. The Campaign in Action: Administrative Aggression & Legislative Failure

#### Weaponizing Regulatory Power
Unable to pass legislation, the campaign pivoted to an aggressive administrative strategy. In March 2024, Secretary of State Michael Watson issued a **cease-and-desist order against BlackRock, Inc.**, accusing the firm of securities fraud for allegedly making misleading statements about its ESG investment strategy. This novel use of a non-financial office's regulatory authority represents a tactical evolution of the SFOF playbook, demonstrating the movement's adaptability when legislative avenues are blocked.

#### A Legislative Firewall
Despite a Republican supermajority and the strong backing of top state officials, the campaign to codify the anti-ESG agenda into law has been a story of persistent failure. A multi-year effort to pass a "pecuniary factors only" law based on the ALEC/Heritage Foundation model has been repeatedly thwarted in the legislature. Bills like **HB 818 (2023)**, **SB 2849 (2023)**, and **SB 2899 (2024)** all died in committee or on the calendar. This legislative stalemate suggests a powerful, though less visible, institutional counter-pressure, likely from the PERS board itself or from business interests wary of the economic consequences.

### IV. Impact on PERS

The sustained political campaign has placed PERS in a precarious position. While the fund's formal policies and portfolio appear insulated, it is operating in an environment of extreme and targeted political hostility.

#### A Bastion of Independence
The PERS Board of Trustees is dominated by active and retired system members, creating a strong institutional incentive to prioritize the financial health of the fund over external political agendas. This is reflected in the fund's governing documents, which are grounded in the traditional "prudent investor" rule and contain no anti-ESG language. The board's apparent resistance is evidenced by the fact that the PERS portfolio contains **no holdings in Israel Bonds**, despite Treasurer McRae's public SFOF commitment to invest in them.

#### The "Chilling Effect"
The true impact of the campaign may be an informal "chilling effect." The constant threat of restrictive legislation and public attacks from top state officials creates a powerful disincentive for fiduciaries to consider politically controversial but potentially material financial risks, such as climate transition risk. This can lead to self-censorship and risk-averse decision-making that ultimately harms the beneficiaries the system is sworn to protect.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign has created a direct conflict with the controlling fiduciary standards established under Mississippi law. The failure of the legislature to change the law means the traditional "prudent investor" standard remains the unambiguous and controlling legal framework.

> "[Fiduciaries] shall discharge their duties with respect to the investments of the system **solely for the interest of the system** with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent investor... would use..."
>
> — Mississippi Code § 25-11-121

The public justifications for anti-ESG actions—combating a "leftist political agenda"—provide prima facie evidence of a dual purpose. A decision made to advance a political goal is, by definition, not made "solely for the interest of the system," creating a clear tension with the duty of loyalty. The failure of the legislative campaign to replace the flexible "prudent person" standard with a rigid "pecuniary factors only" test leaves SFOF-aligned officials operating without the legal cover their counterparts in other states enjoy, creating a higher level of legal risk for them and for any PERS trustee who might comply with their political directives.
