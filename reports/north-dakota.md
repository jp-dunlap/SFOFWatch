### I. The Architecture of Influence

North Dakota, a key energy-producing state, serves as a critical case study in the nuanced implementation of the SFOF playbook. The campaign is characterized by the successful legislative redefinition of fiduciary duty, driven by a State Treasurer deeply integrated into the national SFOF network. However, this campaign has also been met with significant institutional and political resistance, particularly from the state's own financial and business community. This opposition resulted in the overwhelming defeat of more extreme measures, such as a Texas-style anti-boycott law, creating an ongoing conflict between a national political ideology and the principles of prudent financial stewardship.

### II. Key Actors: A Coordinated Political Front

The anti-ESG campaign in North Dakota was driven by the State Treasurer's office, with ideological alignment from the state's other top executive officials.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Thomas Beadle**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Treasurer</span> | **The Primary Operative:** A documented SFOF member and one of the network's most active participants in national pressure campaigns. | Prolific signatory on SFOF letters (opposing DEI, federal climate rules); presented on ESG risks to the ND Legislature alongside other SFOF members. |
| **Kelly Armstrong**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Governor</span> | **The Executive Ally:** Ideologically aligned with the pro-energy, anti-federal regulation goals of the movement. | As statutory Chair of the State Investment Board (SIB), provides powerful political top-cover for the Treasurer's SFOF-aligned activities. |
| **Drew Wrigley**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Attorney General</span> | **Aligned but Divergent:** Aligned on challenging federal environmental regulations. | Notably, has not participated in the direct multi-state anti-ESG legal campaigns targeting financial firms, a significant divergence from the full SFOF playbook. |

### III. The Campaign in Action: Legislative Wins and a Critical Defeat

#### Legislative Victories: Redefining Fiduciary Duty
The campaign achieved its primary goal through a multi-year legislative effort. **Senate Bill 2291 (2021)** was a foundational victory, defining and prohibiting "social investment." This was followed by the more comprehensive **House Bill 1429 (2023)**, which expanded the definition of "social investment" to explicitly include ESG and, most significantly, created a new law governing proxy voting to restrict the influence of mainstream advisory firms.

#### The Anti-Boycott Failure: A Local Firewall
The campaign's attempt to import the most aggressive tactic from the SFOF playbook—a Texas-style anti-boycott law creating a blacklist of financial firms—ended in a decisive and overwhelming defeat, failing in the House by a **90-3 vote**. This failure revealed a crucial fracture in the pro-business coalition, as North Dakota's own banking associations came out in strong opposition, arguing the bill was an anti-competitive government mandate telling banks "who to do business with."

### IV. Impact on the Retirement and Investment Office (RIO)

The anti-ESG campaign has had tangible effects on the governance of the North Dakota Retirement and Investment Office (RIO), which manages ~$23 billion in state funds.

#### A "Cold War" in Governance
The State Investment Board (SIB), which oversees RIO, includes the Governor and Treasurer, creating a direct channel for political influence. However, public records reveal a significant tension between these political actors and RIO's professional staff, who have testified to the legislature about the financial dangers and high costs of anti-ESG policies, directly contradicting the political objectives of their own board members.

#### The Proxy Voting "Poison Pill"
The provision in HB 1429 that forbids RIO from following a proxy advisor's recommendations unless the firm certifies compliance with North Dakota's unique "maximized return" standard is a functional "poison pill." It is designed to sever RIO's access to mainstream corporate governance research from firms like ISS and Glass Lewis, forcing it to either hire a niche anti-ESG firm, bring the costly analysis in-house, or abstain from voting on contentious issues.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign in North Dakota resolved the conflict between political action and legal duty by legislatively redefining the duty itself. The new laws weaponized the concept of "social investment" to legally carve out ESG as a presumptively illegitimate consideration.

> "[Social investment is] the consideration of socially responsible criteria... for the purpose of obtaining an effect **other than a maximized return to the state**."
>
> — North Dakota Senate Bill 2291 (2021)

This new legal framework creates a "fiduciary trap." Under the state's traditional "prudent investor rule" (NDCC § 21-10-07), a fiduciary could be sued for failing to consider a foreseeable material risk, like climate change. The new laws invert this liability. A fiduciary who now considers that same risk faces political and legal jeopardy for potentially engaging in a prohibited "social investment." This coerces fiduciaries into ignoring a category of potentially material financial risks to comply with a political mandate, potentially forcing them to act imprudently.
