### I. The Sooner State Stalemate

As a key energy-producing state, Oklahoma is a critical battleground for the anti-ESG campaign. While the SFOF network successfully captured the State Treasurer's office to implement its national blueprint, the campaign was met with significant and effective resistance from the state's largest public pension fund and, ultimately, its judiciary. The result is a high-stakes legal and political stalemate that has, for now, neutralized the state's anti-ESG law, making Oklahoma a crucial case study on the limits of SFOF's influence and the resilience of institutional fiduciary duties.

### II. Key Actors: A Fractured Front

The anti-ESG campaign in Oklahoma has been driven by the State Treasurer but has not enjoyed unified support, with the Attorney General creating a public and significant fracture in the executive front.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Todd Russ**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Treasurer</span> | **The Primary Operative:** A documented SFOF member, ALEC alumnus, and recipient of SFOF's 2023 "Rising Star" award. | Signed numerous SFOF letters; created and enforced the state's blacklist of financial companies under the Energy Discrimination Elimination Act (EDEA). |
| **Gentner Drummond**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Attorney General</span> | **A Complicated Ally:** Aligned on protecting the energy industry but has publicly feuded with the Treasurer over the anti-ESG law's legal defense. | Joined letters opposing "Net-Zero" standards but publicly blamed Treasurer Russ's legal strategy for the EDEA's initial court defeat, breaking the "pincer movement." |

### III. The Campaign in Action: A Law on Trial

#### The Legislative Blueprint: The Energy Discrimination Elimination Act (EDEA)
The centerpiece of the campaign is the **Energy Discrimination Elimination Act of 2022 (HB 2034)**. The law, a direct implementation of ALEC's model "Eliminate Political Boycotts Act," authorizes the State Treasurer to create a blacklist of financial companies that "boycott energy companies" and prohibits state entities from contracting with them. In May 2023, Treasurer Russ issued the first list, which included major firms like BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of America.

#### The Fiduciary Firewall: OPERS Defies the Treasurer
The law's divestment mandate was immediately checked by a powerful "fiduciary firewall." The Oklahoma Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS) Board of Trustees, facing a requirement to divest over 60% of its portfolio (~$6 billion) from BlackRock at an estimated cost of $10 million, voted **9-1** to invoke the law's fiduciary duty exemption. Treasurer Russ was the lone dissenting vote. This action demonstrated how an independent board can use a law's own language to subvert its political intent.

### IV. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis: The Judicial Brick Wall

The conflict between the EDEA's political mandate and the fiduciary duties of the state's pension fiduciaries ultimately escalated into a decisive legal battle that has, for now, halted the entire campaign.

> "[Public pension funds] shall be operated for the **exclusive purpose of providing benefits to its pensioners**."
>
> â€” Oklahoma Constitution, Article 23, Section 12

In a lawsuit brought by a retired state employee (**Keenan v. Russ**), an Oklahoma County District Court issued a permanent injunction in July 2024, blocking the enforcement of the EDEA. The judge found a "substantial likelihood of success" that the law was unconstitutionally vague and, most critically, that it violated the state constitution's "exclusive benefit" clause. The court's ruling effectively declared that the state's politically motivated anti-boycott law was not a defense of fiduciary duty but a direct violation of it. While the case has been appealed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court, this judicial brick wall represents the most powerful check on the SFOF agenda in the state to date.
