### I. The Architecture of Influence

The anti-ESG campaign in North Carolina represents a textbook execution of the SFOF playbook, successfully weaponizing the concept of fiduciary duty to codify a political ideology into state law. During his tenure from 2017-2025, former State Treasurer **Dale Folwell**, a Republican with deep ties to both SFOF and ALEC, served as the primary conduit for this agenda. He was one of the movement's most active and high-profile operatives, positioning North Carolina as a key battleground for the implementation of the national strategy.

However, the North Carolina story presents a unique and unexpected evolution. The election of a new, unaffiliated State Treasurer in 2024, **Brad Briner**, marked a significant political discontinuity, creating a complex and evolving narrative of both successful political capture and subsequent structural resistance.

### II. Key Actors & A Contested Landscape

The campaign was driven by the Treasurer's office and legislative allies, but faced consistent opposition from the state's Democratic executive branch.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dale Folwell**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Former State Treasurer</span> | **The Operative:** A key SFOF operative and former ALEC member, deeply integrated into the national network. | Prolific signatory on SFOF letters (opposing climate regulation, DEI, etc.); led a public campaign against BlackRock CEO Larry Fink; reclaimed proxy voting authority from BlackRock. |
| **NC General Assembly**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Republican Leadership</span> | **The Legislative Ally:** Provided the legislative power to codify the SFOF agenda into law. | Successfully passed House Bill 750, the state's landmark anti-ESG law, and successfully overrode a veto from the Democratic Governor. |
| **Brad Briner**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Current State Treasurer</span> | **The Unaffiliated Professional:** A career investment manager with no ties to the SFOF network. | Championed and enacted the 2025 State Investment Modernization Act (HB 506), which dismantled the "sole fiduciary" model previously leveraged by SFOF. |

### III. The Campaign in Action: From Rhetoric to Law

#### Legislative Capture: The Passage of House Bill 750
The ultimate goal of the campaign was achieved in 2023 with the passage of **House Bill 750 (Session Law 2023-64)**. The bill's core provision amended state law to mandate that all investment decisions for state funds be based "only on pecuniary factors." The language was a near-verbatim adoption of The Heritage Foundation's model "State Pension Fiduciary Duty Act." The Republican-controlled General Assembly successfully overrode a veto from Democratic Governor Roy Cooper, demonstrating their ability to enact the anti-ESG agenda even in a divided government.

#### A Governance Revolution: The 2025 Investment Modernization Act
In a major, unexpected break from the SFOF playbook, new Treasurer Brad Briner championed legislation in June 2025 to dismantle the very "sole fiduciary" model that had concentrated all investment authority in his office. The new law, **House Bill 506**, creates a new, independent North Carolina Investment Authority (NCIA) governed by a five-member, politically balanced board of investment professionals. This move, voluntarily initiated by the new Treasurer to relinquish his own power, represents a profound structural shift away from the model SFOF has historically sought to empower.

### IV. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign's primary legal achievement was the successful amendment of state law (G.S. 147-69.7) through HB 750. This fundamentally altered the legal definition of fiduciary duty by hard-coding the SFOF network's ideology directly into the law, resolving the conflict between political action and legal duty by legislatively redefining the duty itself.

> "The State Treasurer... Shall, in the evaluation of an investment... **consider only pecuniary factors**... Environmental or social considerations are pecuniary factors **only if** they present economic risks or opportunities that qualified investment professionals would treat as material economic considerations..."
>
> — N.C. General Statute § 147-69.7 (Post-HB 750)

This new language creates a "fiduciary trap." While appearing to allow for some consideration of ESG risks, its political intent was to create a high legal hurdle and a significant "chilling effect." It shifts the legal presumption, framing ESG factors as inherently non-pecuniary unless a fiduciary can affirmatively prove they meet a narrow economic standard. This transforms a broad principle of professional judgment into a narrow, prescriptive code of conduct, forcing fiduciaries to self-censor for fear of political reprisal.
