### I. The SFOF-Kansas Nexus: An Architecture of Influence

The relationship between the national SFOF organization and key political figures in Kansas is uniquely intertwined, as SFOF was co-founded in Kansas by a state official and maintains its headquarters there. This positions the state not merely as a member but as the operational and ideological home base for the anti-ESG movement. The state serves as both the origin point and a key implementation ground for the national agenda, which is then showcased as a "model" for other states to follow.

### II. Key Actors: An Integrated Network

The campaign in Kansas was driven by a network of officials whose roles overlapped between state governance and the national SFOF organization, representing an unparalleled level of integration.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions & Significance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Derek Kreifels**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Former Asst. State Treasurer</span> | **The Architect:** Co-Founder, former CEO, and current Board Member of SFOF. | Appointed to the KPERS Board of Trustees (July 2023 - late 2024), placing the architect of the national anti-ESG strategy in a direct fiduciary role to execute his own playbook. |
| **Steven Johnson**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Treasurer</span> | **The Official:** A documented SFOF member and ex-officio KPERS Trustee. | A central proponent of HB 2100, admitting his office "helped the Legislature to write and pass" the bill. Active in SFOF national letter campaigns. |

### III. The Campaign in Action: Codifying an Ideology

#### Legislative Capture: The Passage of House Bill 2100
The SFOF/ALEC/Heritage agenda was translated directly into binding Kansas law through **House Bill 2100**, the "Kansas Public Investments and Contracts Protection Act," which became law in April 2023. The law prohibits state agencies from giving preferential treatment based on ESG criteria and requires KPERS fiduciaries to act "solely in the financial interest of the participants."

The law's power lies in its politically charged definitions, which are a near-verbatim adoption of the Heritage Foundation and ALEC model bills. It defines "financial" to explicitly exclude any purpose to "further social, political or ideological interests," thereby legislating that the SFOF worldview is "financial" while any alternative is "political." This was passed despite warnings from KPERS's own Executive Director that the bill could cost the pension fund an estimated **$3.6 billion** in future returns over the next decade.

### IV. The Pension Fund Transformed: Impact on KPERS

The enactment of HB 2100 and the appointment of Derek Kreifels to the KPERS board triggered immediate and significant operational changes at the pension fund, demonstrating the law's direct and intended impact.

#### A New Proxy Regime: The Onboarding of Egan-Jones
On July 1, 2023, the effective date of HB 2100, KPERS made **Egan-Jones Proxy Services** fully operational as its new proxy advisor. This was documented at the very first board meeting attended by Derek Kreifels. Egan-Jones is not a neutral provider; it markets itself as a direct ideological alternative to mainstream advisors, with a "Wealth-Focused" policy that automatically opposes most governance and environmental proposals. This move institutionalizes and automates the SFOF ideology at the operational level under the guise of "complying with the law."

#### Portfolio Politics: Divestment from BlackRock
In March 2024, while Kreifels and Johnson were on the board, KPERS executed a "full exit" from a BlackRock U.S. inflation-linked bond account. This action aligned perfectly with the national SFOF campaign to punish BlackRock, a primary antagonist in the anti-ESG narrative.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The campaign in Kansas weaponized the concept of fiduciary duty, transforming it from a broad principle of care into a narrow, prescriptive code of conduct that serves a political agenda. HB 2100 amended state law to remove ambiguity, making the prohibition on social investing absolute.

> "A fiduciary... shall discharge its duties **solely in the financial interest** of the participants and beneficiaries of the system and shall **consider only financial factors**."
>
> — Kansas Statute § 75-42a03

Derek Kreifels's dual role as a leader of a national political advocacy organization (SFOF) while serving as a KPERS trustee created a powerful appearance of a conflict of interest. A decision to divest from BlackRock or hire Egan-Jones cannot be viewed as a purely financial judgment when it so perfectly aligns with the stated political goals of an organization he leads. This suggests that the independent, state-mandated judgment of a public fiduciary was subordinated to the strategic directives of an external political organization.
