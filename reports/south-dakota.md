### I. The Mount Rushmore Front

South Dakota presents a significant paradox in the national anti-ESG campaign. While its State Treasurer is a deeply integrated and active participant in the SFOF network, the legislative and institutional objectives of the movement have been consistently and decisively thwarted. The state serves as a crucial case study on the limits of SFOF's influence, revealing a landscape where the political activism of a key state official has created a profound conflict with the state's existing fiduciary laws and the apolitical governance of its public pension system.

### II. Key Actors: An Incomplete Front

The anti-ESG campaign in South Dakota is driven almost exclusively by the State Treasurer, lacking the unified "whole-of-government" approach seen in other states.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Josh Haeder**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Treasurer</span> | **The Primary Operative:** A documented SFOF member and one of the network's most prolific participants in national pressure campaigns. | Exhaustive record as a signatory on SFOF letters opposing climate rules, DEI, and "woke" finance; has hosted panels at SFOF national meetings. |
| **Marty Jackley**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Attorney General</span> | **Limited Alignment:** Has not engaged in direct, high-profile anti-ESG activism. | Has joined broader conservative lawsuits against federal environmental rules but has not launched ESG-specific investigations, creating an "incomplete pincer movement." |

### III. The Campaign in Action: A Story of Legislative Stalemate

#### A Legislative Firewall
The most unique feature of the South Dakota case is the consistent and decisive failure of anti-ESG legislation. Despite a Republican-controlled legislature and the strong advocacy of the Treasurer, a series of bills based on national ALEC/Heritage models have been defeated in committee between 2022 and 2024, often by large, bipartisan margins. Bills like **SB 182 (2022)**, **HB 1207 (2023)**, and **HB 1247 (2024)** were all rejected. This pattern points to a powerful institutional firewall, likely a coalition of the state's banking and business lobbies combined with a more moderate brand of fiscal conservatism in the legislature.

### IV. Impact on the South Dakota Retirement System (SDRS)

Despite the Treasurer's political campaign, the South Dakota Retirement System (SDRS) and its managing body, the South Dakota Investment Council (SDIC), have remained institutionally insulated from the SFOF agenda.

#### An Apolitical Framework
The SDIC's Investment Policy Statement is grounded in the traditional "prudent person standard" and is entirely devoid of the politically charged terms "ESG" or "pecuniary factors." The legislative firewall has left this professional investment framework intact. Furthermore, an analysis of the SDRS portfolio reveals no direct holdings in Israel Bonds, a signature politically motivated investment promoted by the SFOF network, underscoring the system's independence.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The Treasurer's political activism appears to be in direct conflict with the plain language of South Dakota's fiduciary statutes, particularly a unique and powerful pre-existing prohibition against "social investment."

> "The assets of the system **may not be managed in any manner for the purposes of social investment**. The State Investment Council shall invest member trust funds in a manner that is **solely designed to provide for the exclusive benefit of the members**..."
>
> — South Dakota Codified Law § 3-12C-223

This statute creates a direct conflict for the Treasurer. SFOF's mission is fundamentally social and political (combating "woke capitalism"). By using his state office to advance this mission, the Treasurer introduces a collateral political purpose into his official actions, creating a prima facie conflict with the state's uncompromising "no social investment" and "exclusive benefit" mandates. This law is a double-edged sword: while it could be used to attack pro-ESG considerations, it could just as easily be used to challenge a politically motivated campaign to ignore material risks for ideological reasons.
