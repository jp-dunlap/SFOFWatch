### I. The SFOF-Florida Nexus

Florida serves as both a primary battleground and a model blueprint for the national anti-ESG campaign. The state's unique governance structure for its public pension fund—the Florida Retirement System (FRS)—proved to be the ideal entry point. The FRS is overseen by the State Board of Administration (SBA), whose trustees are the state's three highest elected officials: the Governor, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Attorney General.

The complete political alignment of these three officials with the national SFOF network created the perfect conditions for the rapid and thorough execution of the SFOF playbook, representing a successful capture of state financial machinery to serve a national political ideology.

### II. The Anti-ESG Triumvirate

The anti-ESG agenda was implemented through the immense power vested in the SBA, controlled by a three-member Board of Trustees who were all active champions of the national anti-ESG cause.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ron DeSantis**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Governor</span> | **National Leader:** Positioned himself as a national leader of the movement, forming a multi-state "alliance" of GOP governors to combat ESG. | As SBA Chair, he spearheaded the resolution to divest from ESG-linked investments and championed and signed the landmark anti-ESG bill, HB 3, into law. |
| **Jimmy Patronis**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">CFO (2017-2025)</span> | **The Operative-in-Chief:** A documented SFOF member and active participant in national campaigns. Speaker at ALEC events on ESG. | Directed the $2 billion divestment from BlackRock and oversaw massive, politically justified investments in Israel Bonds, a product of an SFOF corporate sponsor. |
| **James Uthmeier**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Attorney General</span> | **The Legal Enforcer:** Appointed by DeSantis, he has used the legal and regulatory power of his office to reinforce the campaign. | Launched investigations into proxy advisors' ESG policies and climate disclosure groups (as a "Climate Cartel"); barred his office from retaining outside counsel with DEI policies. |

### III. Weaponizing State Power

#### The Divestment Playbook: Punitive Action Against BlackRock
In December 2022, then-CFO Patronis announced that the Florida Treasury would pull **$2 billion in state assets** from management by BlackRock. At the time, it was the largest single anti-ESG divestment by any state, a move calculated to generate national media attention. The public rationale was a direct echo of SFOF's messaging, with Patronis declaring Florida would not use its cash to "fund BlackRock's social-engineering projects."

#### Codifying Ideology: The Passage of House Bill 3
The ultimate goal was achieved in May 2023 with the passage of **House Bill 3**, a sweeping anti-ESG law. Its central pillar is the mandate that all investment decisions for public funds be based "only on pecuniary factors." The law's power lies in its politically charged definition, which excludes "the furtherance of any social, political, or ideological interests." This language is a near-verbatim adoption of the Heritage Foundation's model bill, effectively weaponizing the concept of fiduciary duty itself by transforming a flexible standard of professional judgment into a rigid ideological straitjacket.

#### Portfolio Politics: The Case of Israel Bonds
The state's investment in Israel Bonds demonstrates a complete, self-reinforcing cycle of political influence. First, an SFOF corporate sponsor (Israel Bonds) is promoted by an SFOF member (CFO Patronis), who directs hundreds of millions in public funds into the product for explicitly political reasons. Then, when standard financial risk metrics (a Moody's credit downgrade) threatened the investment, the legislature passed **SB 1674** to create a special exemption, insulating the politically favored investment from normal financial scrutiny.

### IV. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign has placed the actions of Florida's top officials in direct tension with the long-established fiduciary duties that govern the FRS Trust Fund.

> "A fiduciary shall discharge his or her duties with respect to a plan **solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries** for the **exclusive purpose of providing benefits**..."
>
> — Florida Statute 112.656(1)

The public justifications for the BlackRock divestment and the Israel Bonds investment strongly suggest a political motive. A legal challenge could argue that these decisions were not made "solely" for the financial benefit of FRS members, but also to achieve a collateral political purpose, which could be viewed as a breach of the "exclusive purpose" rule. Furthermore, by legally defining certain risks (like climate change) as off-limits for political reasons, HB 3 may compel fiduciaries to act imprudently, placing them in an untenable bind between a restrictive state statute and their overarching duty to consider all material factors.
