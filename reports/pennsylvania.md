|### I. The Architecture of Influence

Pennsylvania serves as a critical case study in how the SFOF agenda is advanced in a state with a divided government. With sweeping anti-ESG legislation largely blocked, the campaign has been advanced primarily through the executive authority of the State Treasurer's office. This has created a direct conflict with the established governance and legally mandated fiduciary duties of the state's two largest public pension funds: the Public School Employees' Retirement System (PSERS) and the State Employees' Retirement System (SERS).

### II. Key Actors: A Contested Landscape

The anti-ESG campaign in Pennsylvania is primarily driven by the State Treasurer, who serves as a key operative in the national SFOF network.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stacy Garrity**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Treasurer</span> | **The Primary Operative:** A documented SFOF member and active participant in national pressure campaigns. | Prolific signatory on SFOF letters (opposing DEI, climate rules); has directed large, politically-justified investments into Israel Bonds, an SFOF corporate sponsor. |
| **PA General Assembly**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Republican Legislators</span> | **The Legislative Allies:** Provide legislative support and amplify the movement's core messages. | Repeatedly introduced anti-ESG legislation (HB 2799, HB 334) based on national models, framing ESG as a threat from "global oligarchs." |

### III. The Campaign in Action: Administrative Pressure & Legislative Stalemate

#### A Legislative Firewall
Due to Pennsylvania's divided government, the legislative arm of the anti-ESG campaign has been consistently unsuccessful. Bills based on ALEC/Heritage models, such as the **"Virtue, Liberty, and Independence Act" (HB 2799 & HB 334)**, have repeatedly failed to advance out of committee. While these bills fail to become law, their introduction serves a strategic purpose by generating media coverage and creating a public narrative of ESG as a threat, which provides political cover for the Treasurer's administrative actions.

#### Portfolio Politics: The Case of Israel Bonds
The most concrete administrative action has been the Treasury's large and growing investment in Israel Bonds, which will total **$64.5 million** by July 2025. This is a textbook example of portfolio politics, as the underwriter for Israel Bonds is a documented SFOF corporate sponsor. Treasurer Garrity's public justification for the investment was explicitly political—to "show our support"—rather than being framed solely in terms of risk and return, creating a symbiotic relationship between the SFOF network and its financial backers.

### IV. Impact on Public Pension Funds (PSERS & SERS)

The anti-ESG campaign has created significant pressure on the state's two largest pension funds, with the Treasurer's ex officio board seats on both PSERS and SERS serving as the primary channel for influence.

#### The Proxy Voting Battlefield
The proxy voting policies of the funds, particularly PSERS, represent a significant point of friction. The PSERS U.S. Proxy Voting Policy, executed by advisor Glass Lewis, explicitly states that PSERS **"encourages diversity in experience, gender, race and age"** on corporate boards. This pro-diversity stance is a direct flashpoint with the national anti-DEI campaign that Treasurer Garrity has personally endorsed through SFOF letters, making the PSERS proxy policy a likely future target for revision.

#### The "Chilling Effect"
The sustained political pressure from the Treasurer's office creates a powerful "chilling effect." A prudent fiduciary might conclude that a long-term risk like climate change is financially material. However, in the current political climate, acting on that analysis could be publicly attacked as "woke investing." This creates a "fiduciary trap" where the path of least political resistance is to avoid addressing politically sensitive but financially material risks, potentially leading to a dereliction of their duty of prudence.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign has created a direct conflict with the controlling fiduciary standards established under Pennsylvania law. The absence of a "pecuniary factors only" law means the traditional, broader standard remains the controlling legal authority.

> "[The board shall] exercise that degree of judgment, skill and care under the circumstances then prevailing which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence who are familiar with such matters exercise... [and] shall stand in a fiduciary relationship to the members of the system...and shall not profit either directly or indirectly."

Treasurer Garrity's dual roles—as an SFOF operative and a legal fiduciary—create a significant potential conflict of interest. The "sole interest" rule of Pennsylvania law is uncompromising. A decision made to advance the political goals of SFOF, such as rewarding a corporate sponsor with a public investment, is by definition not made "solely in the interests of the beneficiaries." These actions create a prima facie tension with the statutory duty of loyalty enshrined in Pennsylvania's Retirement Codes.
