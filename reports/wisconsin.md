### I. The Cowboy State Crossroads

Wyoming presents a unique case study on the limits of the SFOF network's influence. While the State Treasurer is a deeply integrated SFOF operative, the full implementation of the anti-ESG playbook has been thwarted by a "fractured blueprint." The national agenda has collided with Wyoming's unique political culture of pragmatic, libertarian-inflected conservatism. The result is not a successful political capture, but a state of unresolved tension between a national political movement and the state's own institutional and legal firewalls, making it a story of persistent but largely unsuccessful political pressure.

### II. Key Actors: A Fractured Front

While SFOF established a beachhead through the Treasurer's office, its "whole-of-government" campaign fractured due to ideological divisions within the state's conservative leadership.

| Official / Title | SFOF/ALEC Affiliation & Role | Key Actions & Stance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Curt Meier**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Treasurer</span> | **The Primary Operative:** A documented SFOF member and long-time ALEC member. | Prolific signatory on SFOF letters; voted for the state's anti-ESG investment policy; but broke from SFOF to oppose punitive measures in legislation. |
| **Mark Gordon**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Governor</span> | **The Gubernatorial Guardrail:** Aligned with the anti-ESG movement but opposed to its tactics. | Joined a 19-governor anti-ESG coalition but issued line-item vetoes of anti-ESG rules, calling them government overreach and an infringement on personal choice. |
| **Bridget Hill**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Former Attorney General</span> | **An Incomplete Pincer:** Maintained a low public profile on ESG. | Joined one lawsuit against investors harming the coal industry but did not engage in the broader, high-profile anti-ESG legal campaigns seen in other states. |

### III. The Campaign in Action: Administrative Capture, Legislative Defeat

#### Administrative Capture: The SLIB Policy Shift
The movement's most significant victory was the August 2023 adoption of a restrictive new investment policy by the State Loan and Investment Board (SLIB), which is composed of the state's five top elected officials. The policy is explicitly anti-ESG, framed in highly political language, and grants the Treasurer's office authority to take action, including divestment, if an investment partner acts in a "non-pecuniary manner."

#### Legislative Stalemate
The ultimate goal of codifying the SFOF agenda into binding state law has been a persistent failure. A series of bills based directly on ALEC and Heritage Foundation models—**SF 159 (2023)**, **HB 210 (2023)**, and **HB 80 (2025)**—all failed to pass. The legislation was defeated by pragmatic, fiscal-based opposition from the state's own financial stewards, including the Wyoming Retirement System (WRS) and even Treasurer Meier himself, who argued the bills were financially unworkable and would harm the state's ability to attract top-tier investment managers.

### IV. Impact on the Wyoming Retirement System (WRS)

A stark divergence exists between the politically captured State Loan and Investment Board and the institutionally independent Wyoming Retirement System.

#### An Apolitical Framework
The WRS Investment Policy Statement is a traditional, apolitical document grounded in standard fiduciary principles. It contains no mention of "ESG" or "pecuniary factors." This institutional adherence to traditional principles, combined with its independent Board of Trustees, has allowed WRS to serve as an effective "institutional firewall," protecting the state's pension fund from the direct political interference that captured the SLIB.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign has created an unresolved conflict with the controlling fiduciary standards of Wyoming law. The failure of the legislative push leaves the SLIB's politically-motivated policy in a state of direct tension with the state's Uniform Prudent Investor Act.

> "A trustee shall administer the trust **solely in the interests of the beneficiaries** as their interests are defined under the terms of the trust."
>
> — Wyoming Statutes § 4-10-802(a)

Wyoming's "sole interest" rule strictly prohibits a fiduciary from acting with a dual purpose. The SLIB's anti-ESG policy, with its explicitly ideological language, is prima facie evidence of a political purpose. An action taken to advance a state political agenda is, by definition, not made "solely in the interest of the beneficiaries," creating a direct conflict with the plain language of the duty of loyalty. The failure of the anti-ESG legislation means the traditional, broader standard of prudence remains the law of the land, leaving the SLIB's policy legally precarious.
