### I. The SFOF-Arizona Relationship

The anti-ESG agenda in Arizona is the direct outcome of a coordinated alignment between the state's most powerful financial officer and the national SFOF network. State Treasurer Kimberly Yee, an active SFOF member with a long history in the ALEC ecosystem, serves as the primary conduit for the network's ideology and objectives. However, this campaign has not gone uncontested. The state's divided government, particularly the Attorney General's office, represents a significant point of political friction, preventing the "whole-of-government" capture seen in other states.

### II. Key Actors & A Contested Landscape

#### Treasurer Kimberly Yee: A Key National Operative
Treasurer Yee is a consistent and high-profile participant in SFOF's national campaigns. Her record includes signing numerous multi-state letters opposing federal climate regulations, corporate DEI policies, and the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin to the Federal Reserve. Her public rhetoric directly mirrors the SFOF narrative, denouncing ESG as a "political scorecard" and a "dangerous" trend from "woke corporations."

#### Attorney General's Office: A Check on SFOF Power
The SFOF playbook was disrupted by the 2022 election of Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes. In a decisive reversal of her Republican predecessor's policy, Mayes withdrew Arizona from multi-state investigations into the ESG practices of major financial institutions in February 2023. She publicly framed the prior investigations as "politicized" and asserted that "it is not the place of government to tell corporations and their investors that they cannot invest in sustainable technologies." This action effectively broke the legal pincer of the national SFOF strategy in Arizona.

### III. The Anti-ESG Campaign: Executive Action & Legislative Defeat

#### Weaponizing the Treasury: Administrative Actions
Unable to pass legislation, the campaign has relied on the administrative power of the Treasury:

* **Divestment from BlackRock:** In December 2022, Treasurer Yee announced the divestment of $543 million from BlackRock money market funds, explicitly citing the firm's focus on "social issues and wokeism."
* **Internal Anti-ESG Policy:** In August 2022, the Treasury adopted a new investment policy stipulating that fiduciaries may not vote shares based upon "non-pecuniary factors," an attempt to institutionalize the SFOF ideology within her own domain.

#### Legislative Battlefield: A Gubernatorial Firewall
Despite a receptive Republican-controlled legislature, the anti-ESG movement's ultimate goal of codifying its agenda into state law has been consistently thwarted by the gubernatorial veto of Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs. Numerous bills between 2023 and 2025, which directly mirrored the Heritage Foundation's model "Fiduciary Duty Act" by seeking to impose a "pecuniary factors only" mandate, were passed by the legislature but ultimately vetoed. This gubernatorial firewall has been a crucial check on the full implementation of the SFOF agenda.

### IV. Impact on the Arizona State Retirement System (ASRS)

The ASRS has remained largely insulated from the political agenda, a resilience attributed to its independent governance structure and the failure of anti-ESG legislation to become law.

#### Institutional Divergence
The ASRS's official Investment Policy Statement is a traditional, apolitical document that contains **no mention of "ESG," "pecuniary factors," or "non-pecuniary factors."** This stands in stark contrast to the explicit anti-ESG policy adopted by the Treasurer's office. Furthermore, the ASRS continues to use mainstream proxy advisors (ISS and Glass Lewis) and has no documented holdings in Israel Bonds, another clear divergence from the Treasurer's politically motivated investment strategy.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign in Arizona has created a significant conflict with the fiduciary duties prescribed by state law. The Treasurer's actions are aligned with a proposed but repeatedly rejected legal standard, placing them in direct tension with the existing and controlling law.

> "A fiduciary shall discharge their duties: **Solely in the interest of the members and beneficiaries** and For the **exclusive purpose of providing benefits** to members and beneficiaries."
>
> — Arizona Revised Statutes § 38-848.04

The public justifications for the Treasurer's actions—divesting from BlackRock due to "wokeism" and investing in Israel Bonds to "show our support"—are prima facie evidence of a dual purpose. This introduction of a collateral political purpose is in direct tension with the "solely in the interest" and "exclusive purpose" rules of Arizona law. The failure of the legislative campaign to replace the traditional "prudent person" standard with a narrow "pecuniary factors only" rule leaves these actions legally exposed.
