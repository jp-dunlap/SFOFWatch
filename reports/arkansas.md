### I. The Architect and the Network

The campaign to direct Arkansas's public funds toward politically favored investments was not the product of independent financial judgment but the calculated culmination of a multi-pronged political influence campaign. This campaign was led by SFOF-aligned state officials and amplified by the national political network of the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF).

Key officials, including State Auditor **Dennis Milligan**, are deeply enmeshed in the SFOF network, actively collaborating in its political campaigns. The evidence demonstrates that Arkansas's pension systems were not merely making investments; they were being conscripted into a national political crusade, with SFOF-aligned officials acting as the direct conduits for the network's ideological agenda.

### II. The Pension Pipeline: A Coordinated Capture

In June 2025, a rapid-fire sequence of decisions by the state's two largest pension funds—the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System (ATRS) and the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System (APERS)—represented the successful capture of the state's retirement system governance, bending it toward political ends and committing a combined **$100 million** to a single, politically sensitive foreign sovereign bond.

#### The Israel Bond Proposition: A One-Two Punch
The decision to invest a total of **$100 million in Israeli sovereign bonds** across two pension funds, in addition to the **$55 million already held by the State Treasury**, was not the result of a rigorous, impartial financial analysis. The process was driven from the outside by political officials for explicitly non-pecuniary reasons.

* **June 2, 2025 (ATRS):** Under pressure from Auditor Milligan, an ex-officio trustee, the ATRS board approved an investment of up to $50 million.
* **June 11, 2025 (APERS):** The APERS board followed suit, authorizing its own investment of up to $50 million.

These actions were advanced despite multiple public credit downgrades and negative outlooks from S&P Global Ratings and Moody's, and in the case of ATRS, were pushed through by circumventing the board's own due diligence policy.

#### The Proxy Ploy: Weaponizing Compliance with Egan-Jones
Concurrent with the investment push at ATRS, the Board voted to hire **Egan-Jones Proxy Services**. Presented as a step to ensure compliance with state law, this was a strategic maneuver to embed a political ideology into the system's core governance. Egan-Jones is an explicitly anti-ESG firm whose "Wealth-Focused Policy" mandates a blanket vote against entire categories of shareholder proposals related to human rights, climate risk, and DEI. This action represents an abdication of the Board's duty to conduct independent, case-by-case analysis of potential financial risks.

### III. Case Study: The APERS Israel Bond Investment

The APERS board's authorization to invest $50 million in Israel Bonds on June 11, 2025, serves as a textbook example of portfolio politics. The decision was not driven by an independent, risk-based analysis from within the pension fund, but by the explicit political and economic development goals of the state's executive branch, led by Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

#### A Dual Rationale
The investment was publicly justified through a dual lens: as a "sound investment" offering strong returns, and as a geopolitical statement to "show our support" for Israel. This narrative, heavily promoted during the Governor's trade mission to Israel, directly links the state pension fund's capital to the administration's foreign policy and its industrial policy of attracting Israeli defense and technology firms to Arkansas.

#### An Asset with Unique Risks
A purely financial analysis reveals an asset class with substantial risks that appear inadequately compensated by the yield premium. These include:

* **Sovereign Credit Risk:** The investment was made despite recent credit downgrades and negative outlooks for Israeli sovereign debt from major rating agencies.
* **Liquidity Risk:** Israel Bonds are not traded on a secondary market, meaning APERS cannot easily sell its position to rebalance its portfolio or exit the investment if its risk profile changes.
* **Geopolitical Risk:** The bonds' value is inextricably linked to the security and political volatility of the Middle East, introducing a type of risk that is difficult to diversify.

### IV. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis: The Anatomy of a Breach

The actions of the ATRS and APERS boards represent a profound and multi-faceted breach of fiduciary duty, specifically contravening the "pecuniary factors only" mandate of the State Government Employee Retirement Protection Act (Act 498 of 2023).

> "A fiduciary's evaluation of an investment... shall take into account **only pecuniary factors**... 'Pecuniary factor' does not include the furtherance of environmental, social, political, ideological, or other goals."
>
> — Arkansas Code § 24-2-804(a)

* **Breach of Loyalty:** The Israel bond investments were initiated and advanced for political and ideological reasons ("to show our support"), not for their standalone financial merits. This direct pursuit of a nonpecuniary political goal is a clear violation of the statute.
* **Breach of Prudence:** The boards failed to conduct adequate due diligence on the bond investments, ignoring multiple credit downgrades and profound liquidity risks. The ATRS board also improperly delegated its duty of analysis by adopting Egan-Jones's rigid, ideological voting policy, which precludes case-by-case evaluation of whether a shareholder proposal presents a material financial risk.
* **Weaponizing the Law:** The hiring of Egan-Jones was a move to avoid the analytical work that true compliance with Act 498 requires. The law mandates fiduciaries to evaluate if an ESG issue is a pecuniary factor; the Egan-Jones policy is designed to circumvent this analysis by pre-judging all such proposals as non-pecuniary.
