### I. The Architecture of Influence

The anti-ESG campaign in Iowa is a direct extension of the national SFOF strategy, with the State Treasurer's office and the Attorney General's office serving as the primary conduits for this agenda. These offices have operated in a coordinated "pincer movement," with the Treasurer applying financial pressure and the Attorney General applying legal pressure, both framing their actions as a defense of Iowa's cornerstone agriculture industry.

However, this campaign has been largely thwarted by the institutional independence and robust fiduciary framework of the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System (IPERS). The result is a high-stakes legal and political stalemate that has, for now, neutralized the anti-ESG movement's legislative ambitions in the state, making Iowa a crucial case study on the limits of SFOF's influence.

### II. Key Actors: A Coordinated Executive Front

The campaign in Iowa was driven by a coordinated front of executive officials who localized the national anti-ESG narrative to focus on the state's agricultural interests.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Roby Smith**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Treasurer</span> | **The Iowa Outpost:** A formal and active SFOF member, consistent signatory on national letter campaigns. | Translated the national anti-ESG narrative for a local audience, stating a key goal is "protecting Iowa's business and industry," particularly agriculture, from harmful investment policies. |
| **Brenna Bird**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Attorney General</span> | **The Legal Enforcer:** An SFOF "Operative" who has taken a national leadership role in legal challenges. | Led a 23-state coalition challenging "Net-Zero" guidelines, framing the legal action as a defense of American agriculture and energy producers against a "radical green scheme." |

### III. The Legislative Battleground: A Campaign of Persistent Failure

#### The ALEC/Heritage Blueprint Stalls
From 2023 to 2025, Republican legislators, with the support of Governor Kim Reynolds, introduced a series of anti-ESG bills based on national ALEC and Heritage Foundation models. These bills sought to prohibit "economic boycotts" (SF 507) and later pivoted to a more sophisticated attack on fiduciary duty and proxy voting (SSB 1056). Despite Republican control of the legislature and governor's office, **none of these major anti-ESG bills have become law in Iowa.**

#### The Fiduciary Firewall: IPERS's Institutional Resistance
A key factor in this legislative failure is the documented, direct opposition from IPERS itself. In a February 2025 meeting, IPERS CEO Greg Samorajski publicly stated the system's concerns with the proposed legislation, arguing it was **"unnecessary"** because existing policy already addressed the intent, and that it would impose **"new, onerous responsibilities on IPERS."** This public opposition from the state's largest pension fund represents a powerful form of institutional resistance, providing political cover for moderate legislators and effectively neutralizing the campaign.

### IV. The Pension Fund Under Pressure: The Governance of IPERS

IPERS has, to date, successfully resisted political pressure, maintaining a posture of institutional independence grounded in traditional fiduciary principles.

#### Independent Governance and Apolitical Policy
IPERS is overseen by an 11-member, bipartisan Investment Board, a structure that diffuses power and creates a buffer against the political agenda of a single elected official. This independence is reflected in the fund's Investment Policy Statement, a traditional, apolitical document grounded in the "prudent person" rule that makes no mention of "ESG" or "pecuniary factors."

#### The Proxy Voting Battlefield: A State of Strategic Ambiguity
The IPERS policy of delegating proxy voting authority to its external investment managers (who include mainstream firms like BlackRock and Wellington) creates a profound internal contradiction: Iowa's own pension fund is empowering the very proxy voting activity that the state's top financial and legal officers are publicly condemning. This unstable equilibrium is the central point of conflict that the failed legislative proposals were designed to shatter.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The fundamental legal conflict in Iowa lies between the existing "prudent person" rule, which governs IPERS, and the "pecuniary factors only" standard that SFOF-backed legislative proposals have sought to impose. The failure of this legislation means the traditional, flexible standard remains the law of the land.

> "A fiduciary shall exercise the **care, skill, prudence, and diligence...which persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs**... with regard to the permanent disposition of the funds, considering the probable income, as well as the probable safety, of their capital."
>
> — Iowa Code §97B.7A

The public statements by Treasurer Smith and AG Bird, framing their actions as a fight to protect a specific industry, introduce a collateral political purpose into their official duties. This dual purpose creates a prima facie conflict with the duty of loyalty, which requires fiduciaries to act "solely in the interest of the participants and their beneficiaries" as mandated by Iowa law. The resilience of IPERS's "fiduciary firewall" has, for now, prevented this political agenda from being codified into a new, restrictive legal standard.
