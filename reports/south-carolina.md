### I. The Architecture of Influence

The anti-ESG campaign in South Carolina is the direct outcome of a coordinated alignment between the state's most powerful financial and legal officers and the national SFOF network. The Treasurer's Office served as the primary conduit for the network's ideology, reinforced by the legal apparatus of the Attorney General's Office. This unified front successfully implemented a pre-packaged agenda, moving from punitive administrative actions to the ultimate goal of the movement: the legislative redefinition of fiduciary duty itself.

### II. Key Actors: A Coordinated Executive Front

The anti-ESG campaign was executed through the parallel and mutually reinforcing actions of the state's top financial and legal officers, creating a powerful "pincer movement" of financial and legal pressure.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Curtis Loftis**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Treasurer</span> | **The Operative-in-Chief:** A deeply integrated SFOF member and part of the network's national strategy task forces. | Prolific signatory on SFOF letters; led the multi-year campaign to divest state funds from BlackRock, culminating in a $200 million withdrawal. |
| **Alan Wilson**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Attorney General</span> | **The Legal Enforcer:** An aligned operative who provided legal pressure to reinforce the Treasurer's campaign. | Joined a multi-state AG letter threatening BlackRock with legal action just two months before the Treasurer's final divestment, creating a coordinated threat. |

### III. The Campaign in Action: From Fiat to Bipartisan Law

#### The Divestment Playbook: Punishing BlackRock
The most high-profile action was the punitive divestment from BlackRock. The campaign culminated on October 10, 2022, with Treasurer Loftis announcing the final **$200 million** withdrawal. The justification was a direct recitation of SFOF's messaging, framing ESG as a "left-wing political agenda." This action manufactured a public crisis, creating the political pretext for a permanent legislative "solution."

#### Legislative Capture: The "ESG Pension Protection Act"
The ultimate goal was achieved in 2024 with the passage of **House Bill 3690**. The bill, based directly on ALEC and Heritage Foundation models, passed with overwhelming bipartisan support (including a unanimous 45-0 vote in the Senate). The law amends state code to require the Retirement System Investment Commission (RSIC) to "only shall consider pecuniary factors in making an investment decision," legally codifying the SFOF ideology.

### IV. Impact on the Retirement System Investment Commission (RSIC)

The anti-ESG campaign has had direct and tangible effects on the governance of the RSIC, the primary fiduciary for the state's ~$47.2 billion pension fund.

#### Institutional Capture of Policy
The most concrete evidence of success is the RSIC's own "Annual Investment Plan." The version updated after H. 3690 passed now explicitly incorporates the new legal reality, stating that the Commission "shall consider only pecuniary factors." The political agenda is no longer just an external legal constraint; it has been formally adopted and internalized as the official governing policy of the RSIC itself.

#### The Proxy Voting "Poison Pill"
H. 3690 forbids the RSIC from hiring any proxy advisory firm unless that firm "commits in writing to follow proxy guidelines that are consistent with" the new "pecuniary factors only" standard. This is a functional "poison pill" designed to sever the RSIC's ties with mainstream governance services like ISS and Glass Lewis and force it into a smaller, politically-aligned ecosystem, regardless of the potential cost to pensioners.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign in South Carolina resolved the conflict between political action and legal duty by legislatively redefining the duty itself to align with a partisan agenda. The new law fundamentally alters the traditional "prudent person" standard.

> "The commission... **only shall consider pecuniary factors in making an investment decision**... 'Nonpecuniary factor' means a factor... collateral to the financial risk or financial return of an investment, and includes the promotion, furtherance, or achievement of environmental, social, or political goals..."
>
> â€” South Carolina House Bill 3690 (2024)

This new legal framework creates a "fiduciary trap." Under the traditional rule, a fiduciary could be sued for failing to consider a material risk, like climate change. Under the new law, a fiduciary is now more likely to be sued for considering that same risk if an opponent can frame it as a "non-pecuniary" goal. The law coerces fiduciaries into adopting a specific political worldview by strategically manipulating their legal liability, transforming fiduciary law from a shield for beneficiaries into a sword for a political agenda.
