### I. The Architecture of Influence

Nebraska presents a uniquely nuanced case study of the SFOF network's influence. Despite the failure to pass signature anti-ESG legislation, the movement achieved a significant partial capture of the state's financial governance. This was accomplished through a coordinated pressure campaign led by top state officials deeply integrated into the SFOF network, culminating in a pivotal administrative shift in the state's proxy voting policy and the placement of a key anti-ESG operative at the head of the state's retirement agency.

### II. Key Actors: A Leadership Hub

The anti-ESG campaign in Nebraska was driven by a coordinated front of executive officials, with the state serving as a national leadership hub for the movement.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **John Murante**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Former State Treasurer</span> | **The Operative-in-Chief:** Served as SFOF's 2022 National Chair, placing him at the apex of the national network. | Led national letter campaigns; spoke at Heritage Foundation events. Now Director of the state retirement system (NPERS), an ex-officio NIC member. |
| **Tom Briese**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Current State Treasurer</span> | **The Successor:** A documented SFOF member who pledged to continue Murante's anti-ESG work. | Maintains the policy direction through a lower-profile approach; active in SFOF national letter campaigns opposing DEI and supporting the FIRM Act. |
| **Mike Hilgers**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Attorney General</span> | **The Legal Enforcer:** An aligned operative providing legal and rhetorical support for the campaign. | Released a 2022 report, "The Endgame of ESG"; joined multi-state lawsuits against federal climate rules and asset managers like BlackRock. |

### III. The Campaign in Action: Administrative Success, Legislative Defeat

#### A Legislative Firewall
The centerpiece of the SFOF/ALEC legislative agenda, a bill to legally redefine fiduciary duty (**Legislative Bill 743**), failed to pass. Despite strong backing from the Treasurer and Attorney General, the bill was "indefinitely postponed" in April 2024. This failure suggests Nebraska's unique nonpartisan, unicameral legislature is more resistant to hyper-partisan, nationally-driven model legislation than other states.

#### The Divestment Playbook: A Warning Shot
While a full divestment was avoided, the Nebraska Investment Council (NIC) took tangible action in early 2023, voting to transfer half of the state's **$7.3 billion** in passive index fund investments from BlackRock to Northern Trust. This move represented a political compromise, allowing the council to send a clear signal to appease anti-ESG proponents while avoiding the higher costs of a full divestment.

### IV. The Pension Fund Transformed: Reshaping the NIC

While the legislative effort failed, the anti-ESG campaign had a direct and lasting impact on the governance and policies of the Nebraska Investment Council (NIC).

#### The Revolving Door: Institutionalizing Influence
In a move of immense strategic significance, former Treasurer and SFOF National Chair **John Murante** stepped down in October 2023 to become the Director of the Nebraska Public Employees Retirement Systems (NPERS). This appointment placed the former national leader of the anti-ESG movement in a permanent, high-level administrative role directly overseeing the state's pension system and sitting as an ex-officio member on the very council he previously pressured as Treasurer.

#### The Proxy Voting Battlefield
Having failed to pass LB 743, the movement achieved a core goal through direct administrative pressure. In September 2023, the NIC voted to replace its existing proxy voting policy. The new policy mandates that the state's proxy advisor must use a policy approved by the council containing **"only those factors that relate to enhancing or protecting the long-term economic value of each investment."** This administrative victory accomplished one of the central goals of the failed legislation.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign in Nebraska weaponized a pre-existing clause in the state's controlling statute to advance its agenda, creating a conflict with the broader principles of fiduciary duty.

> "No assets... shall be invested or reinvested if the **sole or primary investment objective is for economic development or social purposes** or objectives."
>
> — Nebraska Revised Statute § 72-1239.01

The campaign's core legal strategy has been to argue that any consideration of ESG factors constitutes a prohibited "social purpose" under this statute, regardless of its connection to financial risk or return. This interpretation creates a "fiduciary trap." If NIC members consider a long-term climate risk that they prudently believe is financially material, they risk being accused by the Attorney General of violating the "no social purpose" clause. The path of least political resistance is to ignore such factors, which may itself be a breach of their broader duty of prudence to consider all material risks.
