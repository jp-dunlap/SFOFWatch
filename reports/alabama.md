### I. The SFOF-Alabama Relationship

The anti-ESG campaign in Alabama is a direct extension of a coordinated national strategy, built upon operational links between the national SFOF network and key state officials. Alabama's financial and legal leadership constitutes an active and influential outpost for the SFOF's national strategy, forming a "whole-of-government" front to capture the state's financial and legal oversight apparatus.

### II. Key Actors & A Coordinated Front

The campaign in Alabama involves a coordinated effort across the state's key financial and legal executive positions, dramatically amplifying the movement's power.

| **Young Boozer**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Treasurer</span> | **SFOF's Conduit:** A direct participant who co-signed the foundational Nov. 2021 SFOF letter threatening banks over energy boycotts. He maintains a nuanced public profile with leadership in the mainstream NAST to project non-partisanship. | Co-signed the multi-state letter threatening "collective action" against banks. Announced increased state investment in Israel Bonds, a product of an SFOF corporate sponsor. |

### III. The Anti-ESG Campaign in Action

#### Codifying an Ideology: Senate Bill 261

The campaign's ultimate goal was achieved with the 2023 passage of **Senate Bill 261 (Act No. 2023-409)**. A textual analysis reveals its direct lineage from ALEC's model "Eliminate Political Boycotts Act."

* **Prohibition:** The law prohibits governmental entities from entering into contracts of $15,000 or more with companies that engage in an "economic boycott" of politically favored industries (fossil fuels, timber, mining, agriculture, firearms).
* **Broad Definition of "Boycott":** The definition was expanded to also target companies that refuse business with firms that do not facilitate access to abortion or sex and gender-affirming care.
* **A Compromised Blueprint:** The final version of the law contains significant exemptions carved out for the financial industry, likely due to lobbying from local banks. It explicitly exempts contracts related to debt issuance, investment of funds, and procurement of financial products, making the law more symbolic than substantive in its direct impact on finance.

### IV. Impact on the Retirement Systems of Alabama (RSA)

The anti-ESG campaign has created significant institutional friction with the independent fiduciaries of the RSA, whose governance structure has served as a formidable buffer against the direct implementation of the SFOF agenda.

#### A Bastion of Traditional Prudence

The RSA's official Investment Policy Statements are grounded in traditional, apolitical fiduciary principles. Critically, these core documents contain **no mention of "ESG," "pecuniary factors," or "non-pecuniary factors."** The RSA has publicly asserted that while it may consider environmental, social, or governance issues that "impact the profitability of the company," this is simply the "foundation of prudent investing" and not a political policy.

#### The Proxy Voting Battlefield

The RSA does not delegate proxy voting to its external asset managers. Instead, it uses a single third-party advisory firm, **Glass Lewis**, for all its proxy voting needs. This administrative choice inadvertently creates a single, high-value target for the state's anti-ESG proponents and represents the RSA's most significant point of vulnerability to future political pressure.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign in Alabama has created a significant legal conflict. By failing to pass a "pecuniary factors" law to redefine fiduciary duty (a key step in the SFOF playbook), politically motivated actions are left exposed to legal challenge under the state's strong, traditional fiduciary standards.

> "...all assets of public sector retirement systems shall be held, administered, and invested for the **exclusive benefit** of the respective retirement systems and shall not be used or diverted for any other purpose."
>
> — Alabama Constitution, Article V, § 138.03

The "exclusive benefit" and "sole interest" rules of Alabama law strictly prohibit collateral political goals. Public justifications for anti-ESG actions—such as protecting energy industries or supporting political allies—introduce a dual purpose that creates a direct and prima facie conflict with these uncompromising legal standards. This unresolved tension suggests a future legislative push for a "pecuniary factors" law to retroactively justify these actions.
