### I. A Model of Institutional Resistance

Nevada serves as a critical and unique case study in the limits of the SFOF network's influence. The state's status as a politically competitive "purple state" with a divided government has created a model of institutional resistance to the SFOF playbook. The central conflict is an internal schism pitting the pro-SFOF activism of the State Controller against the opposing political stances of the State Treasurer and Attorney General. This dynamic, combined with the deep-rooted institutional independence of the Public Employees' Retirement System of Nevada (NVPERS), has created a powerful firewall against the anti-ESG agenda.

### II. Key Actors: A Divided Executive

Unlike the unified fronts in other states, Nevada's executive branch is a contested landscape, preventing the "pincer movement" strategy from taking hold.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions & Stance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Andy Matthews**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Controller (R)</span> | **The Lone Operative:** A documented SFOF member and the primary conduit for the national anti-ESG agenda in Nevada. | Actively signs national SFOF letters (supporting FIRM Act, Israel Bonds) to advance the network's objectives. |
| **Zach Conine**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Treasurer (D)</span> | **The Active Opponent:** Member of a national coalition of Democratic finance officials organized to counter the SFOF network. | Directed the divestment of $89 million from assault-weapon manufacturers, citing both moral and financial risk factors. |
| **Aaron Ford**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Attorney General (D)</span> | **The Legal Firewall:** No affiliation with the SFOF agenda; has not weaponized his office to target ESG. | Focuses on traditional consumer protection and civil rights, preventing the legal half of the SFOF "pincer movement." |
| **Joe Lombardo**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Governor (R)</span> | **The Non-Aligned Executive:** Has not aligned with the hardline anti-ESG movement. | Issued a nuanced "all-of-the-above" energy policy that affirms the state's renewable energy goals and the need to address climate change. |

### III. The Campaign in Action: A Battle of Rhetoric, Not Law

#### A Legislative Firewall
A critical finding is the notable absence of any significant anti-ESG legislation being successfully passed in the Nevada Legislature. The political reality of a divided government, where a Republican governor faces a legislature with significant Democratic influence, makes the passage of controversial, ideologically-driven model legislation politically untenable. This "Purple State Firewall" has been a powerful institutional check on the SFOF agenda.

#### Activism by Proxy
In the absence of legislative power, the primary tactic for anti-ESG activism in Nevada has been Controller Matthews's participation in national letter-writing campaigns. This allows the SFOF network to claim a broader coalition of support for its initiatives, lending Nevada's name to national pressure campaigns even if it has no direct, tangible impact on investment policy within the state itself.

### IV. The Public Employees' Retirement System of Nevada (NVPERS)

NVPERS has remained institutionally insulated from the national anti-ESG political campaign, a resilience rooted in its governance and a unique historical precedent.

#### The Paradox of Pre-Alignment
The NVPERS investment policy has explicitly prohibited "social investing" for over 15 years, a policy rooted in a 2008 Nevada Attorney General Opinion. The policy states that "PERS Fund investment must not become influenced by political or social issues, as its only purpose is to fund the members' retirement through prudent investing." This long-standing, apolitical "pecuniary factors only" rule predates the modern anti-ESG movement, neutralizing the SFOF narrative that the system has been captured by "woke" ideology and making new, politically motivated laws appear redundant.

#### Adherence to Mainstream Practice
NVPERS continues to delegate proxy voting to its roster of mainstream, global asset managers like BlackRock and State Street. There is no evidence of any move to hire a niche, ideologically-aligned anti-ESG firm, confirming that the system's shareholder engagement strategy has not been captured by the SFOF political campaign.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis: A Conflict in Waiting

While the anti-ESG campaign has failed to change Nevada law or NVPERS policy, the persistent political pressure from SFOF-aligned actors creates a significant "fiduciary trap" for the system's trustees.

> "[The fund] must be invested and administered to assure the **highest return consistent with safety** in accordance with accepted investment practices."
>
> — Nevada Revised Statutes § 286.220

The controlling legal standard for NVPERS fiduciaries is the traditional, flexible "prudent person" rule, which requires a comprehensive evaluation of all factors that could be material to an investment's long-term risk and return. The national anti-ESG campaign, however, has successfully framed any consideration of factors like climate risk as illegitimate "woke" investing. This places the NVPERS board in an untenable position: it is caught between its legal duty to be prudent (which may require considering ESG-related risks) and the political risk of being publicly attacked by the State Controller for doing so. This "chilling effect" represents the most significant, albeit subtle, impact of the anti-ESG campaign in Nevada.
