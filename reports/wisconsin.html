    <h3 class="text-2xl font-lora text-white mb-4 border-b border-cyan-700 pb-2">I. The Wisconsin Stalemate</h3>
    <div class="space-y-4">
      <p>Wisconsin serves as a critical and unique case study on the limits of the SFOF network's influence. While the SFOF network has established a clear foothold through the State Treasurer's office, its policy agenda has been largely stalled. This stalemate is the result of powerful countervailing forces: the political opposition of a Democratic Governor and Attorney General, and the robust institutional and legal firewalls of the independent State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB). The outcome is not one of policy capture, but of unresolved tension and institutional resilience.</p>

      <p>Wisconsin's divided executive branch is the central political dynamic defining its ESG battle, preventing the unified "whole-of-government" approach seen in other states.</p>

        <h4 class="text-lg font-lora text-cyan-400 mb-2">The Gubernatorial Veto: A Decisive Backstop</h4>
        <p>A comprehensive review of legislation reveals that no major bills based on the SFOF/ALEC model have been passed into law in Wisconsin. The political dynamic of a Republican-controlled legislature and a Democratic governor has created a state of gridlock on polarizing issues. Governor Evers's constitutional veto power has been the single most important factor in preventing the passage of any state-level anti-ESG laws, effectively neutralizing the legislative front of the SFOF campaign.</p>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-lora text-white mb-4 border-b border-cyan-700 pb-2">IV. The Institutional Fortress: The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB)</h4>
    <div class="space-y-6">
        <p>The most formidable defense against the SFOF agenda is institutional. SWIB, the independent agency managing the assets of the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS), is protected by a strong governance structure, a clear legal mandate, and a deeply embedded, apolitical culture.</p>
        <div>
            <h4 class="text-lg font-lora text-cyan-400 mb-2">A Preemptive Rejection of Politics</h4>
            <p>SWIB's official <strong class="text-white">"Statement on Divestment"</strong> is a profound act of institutional resistance. It is a single, powerful sentence: "Divestment, as a tool to address social or political issues, falls outside the scope of SWIB's legal mandate and operational framework." This policy preemptively rejects the primary administrative weapon of the anti-ESG movement, creating a powerful shield against political pressure from any direction.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4 class="text-lg font-lora text-cyan-400 mb-2">Adherence to Mainstream Governance</h4>
            <p>SWIB's proxy voting process is governed by detailed guidelines with the stated goal of voting all proxies "solely in the economic and long-term interests of the WRS." It retains a mainstream proxy advisor (ISS) and has publicly noted its practice of voting differently from its advisor's recommendations when its own analysis dictates, refuting the "robovoting" critique often leveled by the anti-ESG movement.</p>

  <!-- Section 5: Legal and Fiduciary Analysis -->
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-2xl font-lora text-white mb-4 border-b border-cyan-700 pb-2">V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis</h3>
    <div class="space-y-4">
      <p>The foundation of SWIB's institutional strength is its clear and unambiguous legal mandate, which is grounded in the traditional, broad "prudent person" standard of care and is fundamentally incompatible with the SFOF worldview.</p>
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-cyan-600 pl-4 italic text-gray-400">
        "[The board shall] administer assets <strong class="text-white">solely for the purpose of ensuring the fulfillment of the purpose of each trust or fund</strong> at a reasonable cost and <strong class="text-white">not for any other purpose</strong>."
        <cite class="block not-italic mt-2 text-sm">— Wisconsin Statutes § 25.15(2)(c)</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Wisconsin's controlling statutes establish an exceptionally high legal bar. The "prudent person" rule requires fiduciaries to consider all information a prudent expert would find relevant to long-term risk and return. The "solely for the purpose" language codifies the duty of loyalty, strictly prohibiting fiduciaries from using the fund's assets to achieve collateral political or social goals. This legal bedrock provides SWIB with a powerful defense against any external pressure to make investment decisions based on a political agenda rather than its fiduciary obligations.</p>
