### I. The Architecture of Influence

Idaho represents a unique case study in the SFOF network's national campaign. The state is not merely a recipient of a pre-packaged agenda but a key architect and exporter of anti-ESG policy. This is the result of a deep, multi-generational integration of the Idaho State Treasurer's office within the SFOF network's highest echelons. This influence has been translated into a coordinated "whole-of-government" approach, culminating in the legislative redefinition of fiduciary duty and creating a profound conflict with the independent governance of the Public Employee Retirement System of Idaho (PERSI).

### II. Key Actors: An Interlocking Directorate

The anti-ESG campaign in Idaho is driven by a coordinated front of officials whose influence is amplified by their deep, structural integration with the national conservative policy apparatus.

| Official / Title | SFOF Affiliation & Role | Key Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Julie Ellsworth**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">State Treasurer</span> | **The Operative-in-Chief:** Holds the high-level position of SFOF National Policy Vice-Chair, placing her at the center of formulating the network's national strategy. | Exhaustive record as a signatory on SFOF letters; co-sponsored SB 1405; hosted a high-profile anti-ESG roundtable with national figures like SFOF's CEO. |
| **Ron Crane**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Former State Treasurer</span> | **The Elder Statesman:** Serves on SFOF's national Board of Directors alongside the CEOs of ALEC and The Heritage Foundation, shaping the movement's highest-level strategy. | Maintains Idaho's long-term, structural link to the SFOF network, providing institutional legitimacy and continuity for the anti-ESG campaign. |
| **Raúl Labrador**<br><span style="font-size: smaller;">Attorney General</span> | **The Legal Enforcer:** Aligned Idaho's legal apparatus with the national anti-ESG legal strategy. | Joined multi-state lawsuits and letter campaigns targeting corporate DEI initiatives and state-level climate litigation, creating a legal "pincer movement." |

### III. The Campaign in Action: From Model to Law

#### Legislative Capture: The ALEC/Heritage Blueprint
The ultimate goal of the campaign was achieved through a direct policy pipeline from SFOF's national partners. The language of Idaho's anti-ESG legislation shows a direct lineage from the model policies of The Heritage Foundation and ALEC.

* **Senate Bill 1405 (2022):** Co-sponsored by Treasurer Ellsworth, this law's core provision states: "No public entity...shall consider environmental, social, or governance characteristics in a manner that could override the prudent investor rule." This language directly implements the Heritage Foundation's strategy of legally subordinating ESG factors to a narrow definition of fiduciary duty.
* **House Bill 191 (2023):** This law prohibits public entities from using ESG standards in government contracting. This directly mirrors the intent of ALEC's model "Eliminate Political Boycotts Act," which uses state procurement power to protect politically favored industries.

#### Manufacturing a Crisis
The passage of this legislation was preceded by carefully staged political events designed to create a public sense of crisis. In June 2022, Treasurer Ellsworth hosted an "Educational Roundtable on ESG" at the State Capitol. The panel was exclusively composed of national anti-ESG advocates, including SFOF's CEO and Utah Treasurer Marlo Oaks. This was not a neutral inquiry but political theater designed to frame ESG as an urgent threat, thereby justifying the pre-determined legislative "solution."

### IV. Impact on the Public Employee Retirement System of Idaho (PERSI)

The anti-ESG campaign has created a significant, unresolved tension with the independent governance of PERSI, which has so far acted as an institutional buffer against the full capture of its investment philosophy.

#### A Bastion of Traditional Prudence
PERSI's core governing document, its "Base Plan Investment Policy," remains grounded in traditional fiduciary principles. It makes no mention of the politically charged terms "ESG," "pecuniary factors," or "non-pecuniary factors." This institutional insulation creates a direct conflict: the state's chief financial officer is a national leader of a political movement whose worldview is entirely absent from the governing document of the state's most important financial institution.

#### The Proxy Voting Battlefield: A Policy of Delegation Under Pressure
The PERSI Board has a policy to "allow full delegation of proxy voting to our investment managers or custodian." While a common practice, this creates a significant vulnerability. It places voting responsibility in the hands of external asset managers who use mainstream proxy advisors like ISS and Glass Lewis—the very firms targeted by the anti-ESG movement. This outsources the conflict, creating a future scenario where PERSI will be caught between its managers' global voting guidelines and the political agenda of the Idaho Treasurer and Attorney General.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign in Idaho has weaponized the concept of fiduciary duty itself, transforming it from a shield for beneficiaries into a sword for a political agenda.

> "Fiduciaries 'shall discharge their duties with respect to the fund **solely in the interest of the members and their beneficiaries**' and for the '**exclusive purpose of providing benefits**.'"
>
> — Idaho Code § 59-1301

The public justifications for anti-ESG actions are explicitly political (combating "woke efforts," protecting "rights and freedoms"). This introduction of a collateral political purpose creates a prima facie conflict with the strict "solely in the interest" and "exclusive purpose" rules mandated by Idaho law. SB 1405 further creates a "fiduciary trap": by legally framing ESG as an external force acting against the prudent investor rule, it creates a legal presumption that ESG factors are inherently suspect. A trustee who prudently considers a material climate risk could now be accused of violating the statute by letting a "social" factor "override" their duty. The path of least legal resistance becomes to ignore the risk, thereby inverting the law's protective purpose.
