### I. The Architecture of Influence

Missouri serves as a quintessential "blueprint" state for the SFOF network, demonstrating a successful, multi-year institutional capture of the State Treasurer's office. This deep integration, which has persisted across administrations, has positioned the state not merely as a participant but as a critical leadership hub for the national anti-ESG movement. The Treasurer's Office and Attorney General's Office have operated in a coordinated "pincer movement" of financial and legal pressure, culminating in the successful legislative redefinition of fiduciary duty itself.

### II. Key Actors: A Coordinated Executive Front

The anti-ESG campaign in Missouri was advanced through the complementary actions of the state's top financial and legal officers, creating a multi-front assault on ESG principles.

### III. The Campaign in Action: From Fiat to Law

#### The Divestment Playbook: Punitive Actions
Missouri has been a leader in using divestment as a political weapon. In October 2022, at the direction of then-Treasurer Fitzpatrick, the Missouri State Employees' Retirement System (MOSERS) sold all **$500 million** of its public equities managed by BlackRock. The justification was explicitly political, accusing the firm of "forcing a left wing social and political agenda." This was followed in 2023 by a successful campaign led by Treasurer Malek to compel MOSERS to divest from all public equities in China, a move that required direct intervention from the Governor's office to override the board's initial rejection.

#### Legislative & Regulatory Capture
After an initial anti-ESG bill (**HB 863**) failed in 2023 and a subsequent regulatory effort by the Secretary of State was struck down by federal courts as unconstitutional, the campaign persisted. The ultimate goal was achieved in 2025 with the successful passage of legislation that amended the state's foundational statute on fiduciary duty (**RSMo 105.688**). This permanently altered the legal landscape, codifying the SFOF network's ideology directly into state law.

### IV. The Pension Fund Transformed: Impact on MOSERS

The anti-ESG campaign has had a direct and lasting impact on the governance and policies of MOSERS, fundamentally reshaping its approach to corporate governance.

#### Institutional Capture of Policy
The most concrete evidence of the campaign's success is the text of the MOSERS Investment Policy Statement (IPS) itself. The IPS was updated to explicitly incorporate the SFOF network's ideology. It now mandates that the system's proxy advisor "shall consider only those factors that relate to the economic value of the System's investments." It further clarifies that voting on all proposals, including social and environmental ones, "will be based **solely on enhancing or protecting long-term economic value**, and not on establishing or endorsing social policy."

#### Seizing the Proxy Vote
This policy change was the culmination of a deliberate strategy to seize control of the proxy voting process. In June 2022, then-Treasurer Fitzpatrick led a successful effort at the MOSERS board to strip all proxy voting authority from the system's external asset managers, centralizing control within the politically influenced board.

### V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis

The anti-ESG campaign in Missouri resolved the conflict between political action and legal duty by legislatively redefining the duty itself to align with a partisan agenda. The 2025 amendment to the state's controlling fiduciary statute represents the campaign's most significant and lasting victory.

> "An investment fiduciary shall... **(7) Not consider environmental, social, or governance characteristics in a manner that would override his or her fiduciary duties** as defined in this section..."
>
> — Missouri Revised Statutes § 105.688 (Post-2025 Amendment)

This new law creates the ultimate "fiduciary trap." It transforms what was a broad, flexible standard of professional judgment (the "prudent person" rule) into a narrow, rigid, and ideological one. Any future trustee who attempts to consider a factor like long-term climate transition risk—even if they prudently believe it is financially material—now faces the legal risk of being accused of violating the state's newly defined fiduciary duty. The law does not merely guide fiduciaries; it coerces them into adopting a specific political worldview by codifying it as the sole definition of prudence.
