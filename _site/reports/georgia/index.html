<h3>I. The Architecture of Influence</h3>
<p>Georgia provides a textbook case study of the successful implementation of the national anti-ESG blueprint. The campaign was not a homegrown phenomenon but the direct result of a coordinated political alignment between the state's most powerful executive officers and the national SFOF network. The parallel and mutually reinforcing actions of the Governor, State Treasurer, and Attorney General created a &quot;whole-of-government&quot; pincer movement that effectively captured the state's financial and legal machinery to serve a national ideological agenda.</p>
<h3>II. The Anti-ESG Triumvirate</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG agenda was advanced through the complementary actions of the state's top financial, legal, and executive officers, creating a multi-front assault on ESG principles.</p>

<h3>III. The Campaign in Action: From Model to Law</h3>
<h4>Legislative Capture: The Passage of House Bill 481</h4>
<p>The legal centerpiece of the campaign is <strong>House Bill 481 (Act 587)</strong>, passed in 2024. The law amends Georgia's &quot;Public Retirement Systems Investment Authority Law&quot; to impose a new, restrictive standard on all state pension fiduciaries. A textual analysis reveals its direct lineage from the model policies of The Heritage Foundation and ALEC.</p>
<p>The law's core mandate is the redefinition of fiduciary duty. It prohibits fiduciaries from promoting any <strong>&quot;nonpecuniary interests,&quot;</strong> which it explicitly defines to include &quot;the furtherance of any social, political, or ideological interests.&quot; This language legally frames any consideration of ESG goals as presumptively illegitimate. The bill was publicly supported by Heritage Action, confirming the direct policy pipeline from the national network to the Georgia statehouse.</p>
<h4>Portfolio Politics: The Case of Israel Bonds</h4>
<p>The state's investment in Israel Bonds demonstrates a complete cycle of political influence. The Development Corporation for Israel, an SFOF corporate sponsor, benefits from a politically motivated investment directive from Governor Kemp, which is then executed by SFOF member Treasurer McCoy. The purchase of $10 million in bonds was explicitly justified to &quot;support its defense efforts,&quot; a clear nonpecuniary, political purpose.</p>
<h3>IV. Impact on ERSGA &amp; TRSGA</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign has had a tangible effect on the governance of the Employees' Retirement System of Georgia (ERSGA) and the Teachers Retirement System of Georgia (TRSGA), which are responsible for the retirement security of over one million Georgians.</p>
<h4>Entrenchment and Coercion</h4>
<p>The passage of HB 481 served a dual purpose. For the ERSGA, whose investment policy already contained language mirroring the SFOF agenda, the law served to legally entrench this ideology, removing any future discretion for the board to adapt. For the TRSGA, which has a more diverse board and no such pre-existing policy, the law imposed a new, external political constraint, coercing compliance through a binding statutory mandate.</p>
<h4>The Proxy Voting Battlefield</h4>
<p>HB 481 creates a new, powerful default position for proxy voting, requiring fiduciaries to vote <strong>&quot;in support of management&quot;</strong> unless doing so would be detrimental to the system's economic interests. This is a strategic maneuver designed to neutralize shareholder engagement as a tool for corporate accountability on ESG-related issues, effectively ceding power to corporate management by default and creating a direct conflict with the standard practices of mainstream proxy advisors like ISS and Glass Lewis.</p>
<h3>V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in Georgia resolved the potential conflict between politically motivated actions and the traditional standard of fiduciary duty by legislatively redefining the duty itself to align with a partisan agenda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A fiduciary... Shall not subordinate the interests of the participants and their beneficiaries or sacrifice investment returns or accept increased investment risks in the promotion of any nonpecuniary interests. Such nonpecuniary interests shall include... the furtherance of any social, political, or ideological interests.&quot;</p>
<p>— O.C.G.A. § 47-20-88</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This new law creates a &quot;fiduciary trap.&quot; A trustee, in their expert judgment, might conclude that a long-term risk like climate change is a material pecuniary factor. However, the political context and the new statutory language create significant legal risk for acting on that determination, as opponents could frame it as the illegitimate pursuit of a &quot;nonpecuniary&quot; goal. The law thereby coerces fiduciaries into adopting the SFOF network's narrow definition of what is &quot;pecuniary&quot; by strategically manipulating their legal risk calculations, inverting the purpose of fiduciary law from a shield for beneficiaries into a sword for political agendas.</p>
