<h3>I. The Architecture of Influence</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in Louisiana demonstrates a successful institutional capture of the State Treasurer's Office across multiple administrations, ensuring the durability of the SFOF network's agenda. This campaign has been executed through a coordinated &quot;whole-of-government&quot; approach, with the Treasurer's Office and the Attorney General's Office operating in a &quot;pincer movement&quot; of financial and legal pressure to execute a national playbook. The state serves as an active and important outpost for the anti-ESG movement, with its actions framed as a necessary defense of Louisiana's cornerstone fossil fuel industry.</p>
<h3>II. Key Actors: A Coordinated Executive Front</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in Louisiana was advanced through the complementary actions of the state's top financial and legal officers, creating a multi-front assault on ESG principles.</p>

<h3>III. The Campaign in Action: From Fiat to Mandate</h3>
<h4>The Signature Move: The BlackRock Divestment</h4>
<p>The most significant anti-ESG action in Louisiana was the punitive divestment from BlackRock in October 2022. Then-Treasurer John Schroder announced the state would liquidate all <strong>$794 million</strong> of its investments with the firm. The rationale was explicitly political: to &quot;protect Louisiana from actions and policies that would actively seek to hamstring our fossil fuel sector.&quot; This action was part of a coordinated national wave of similar divestments by SFOF-aligned states.</p>
<h4>The Legislative Battlefield: Importing a National Agenda</h4>
<p>While a broad &quot;pecuniary factors only&quot; bill has not yet passed, the campaign achieved a significant victory with the 2024 passage of the <strong>&quot;Firearm Industry Nondiscrimination Act&quot; (SB 234)</strong>. The law is a direct implementation of the ALEC model &quot;Eliminate Political Boycotts Act&quot; and establishes a legal precedent in Louisiana for using state contracting power to punish companies for their corporate policies. A persistent, multi-year effort to pass broader anti-ESG legislation based on Heritage Foundation models is ongoing.</p>
<h3>IV. Impact on LASERS &amp; TRSL</h3>
<p>The political campaign has had a direct impact on the governance of the Louisiana State Employees' Retirement System (LASERS) and the Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana (TRSL).</p>
<h4>Ideological Infiltration of Policy</h4>
<p>The two systems show a significant divergence. LASERS maintains an investment policy grounded in traditional, apolitical fiduciary principles. In stark contrast, the TRSL Investment Policy was updated in May 2025 to explicitly state that &quot;Investment decisions should be evaluated on net return relative to risk, <strong>using only pecuniary factors</strong>.&quot; This is a significant victory for the anti-ESG movement, demonstrating that sustained political pressure can compel a pension board to internalize and adopt the movement's core ideological language, even without a state law.</p>
<h3>V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in Louisiana has created a significant conflict with the fiduciary duties prescribed by the state's highest laws. The proposed but not-yet-enacted legal standard is at odds with the existing and controlling law.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The assets of the [public retirement] systems... shall be held, invested as authorized by law, or disbursed as in trust for the <strong>exclusive purpose of providing such benefits</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>â€” Louisiana Constitution, Article X, Section 29</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The public justifications for the BlackRock divestment (protecting the oil and gas industry) and the Israel Bonds investment (&quot;show our support&quot;) are prima facie evidence of a dual purpose. A decision made to advance a state industrial policy or a foreign policy objective is, by definition, not made for the &quot;exclusive purpose&quot; of providing benefits to pensioners and is therefore in direct tension with the duty of loyalty mandated by the Louisiana Constitution. The movement's legislative endgame is to resolve this conflict by changing the law itself to provide retroactive legal cover for these political actions.</p>
