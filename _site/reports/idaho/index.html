<h3>I. The Architecture of Influence</h3>
<p>Idaho represents a unique case study in the SFOF network's national campaign. The state is not merely a recipient of a pre-packaged agenda but a key architect and exporter of anti-ESG policy. This is the result of a deep, multi-generational integration of the Idaho State Treasurer's office within the SFOF network's highest echelons. This influence has been translated into a coordinated &quot;whole-of-government&quot; approach, culminating in the legislative redefinition of fiduciary duty and creating a profound conflict with the independent governance of the Public Employee Retirement System of Idaho (PERSI).</p>
<h3>II. Key Actors: An Interlocking Directorate</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in Idaho is driven by a coordinated front of officials whose influence is amplified by their deep, structural integration with the national conservative policy apparatus.</p>

<h3>III. The Campaign in Action: From Model to Law</h3>
<h4>Legislative Capture: The ALEC/Heritage Blueprint</h4>
<p>The ultimate goal of the campaign was achieved through a direct policy pipeline from SFOF's national partners. The language of Idaho's anti-ESG legislation shows a direct lineage from the model policies of The Heritage Foundation and ALEC.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Senate Bill 1405 (2022):</strong> Co-sponsored by Treasurer Ellsworth, this law's core provision states: &quot;No public entity...shall consider environmental, social, or governance characteristics in a manner that could override the prudent investor rule.&quot; This language directly implements the Heritage Foundation's strategy of legally subordinating ESG factors to a narrow definition of fiduciary duty.</li>
<li><strong>House Bill 191 (2023):</strong> This law prohibits public entities from using ESG standards in government contracting. This directly mirrors the intent of ALEC's model &quot;Eliminate Political Boycotts Act,&quot; which uses state procurement power to protect politically favored industries.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Manufacturing a Crisis</h4>
<p>The passage of this legislation was preceded by carefully staged political events designed to create a public sense of crisis. In June 2022, Treasurer Ellsworth hosted an &quot;Educational Roundtable on ESG&quot; at the State Capitol. The panel was exclusively composed of national anti-ESG advocates, including SFOF's CEO and Utah Treasurer Marlo Oaks. This was not a neutral inquiry but political theater designed to frame ESG as an urgent threat, thereby justifying the pre-determined legislative &quot;solution.&quot;</p>
<h3>IV. Impact on the Public Employee Retirement System of Idaho (PERSI)</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign has created a significant, unresolved tension with the independent governance of PERSI, which has so far acted as an institutional buffer against the full capture of its investment philosophy.</p>
<h4>A Bastion of Traditional Prudence</h4>
<p>PERSI's core governing document, its &quot;Base Plan Investment Policy,&quot; remains grounded in traditional fiduciary principles. It makes no mention of the politically charged terms &quot;ESG,&quot; &quot;pecuniary factors,&quot; or &quot;non-pecuniary factors.&quot; This institutional insulation creates a direct conflict: the state's chief financial officer is a national leader of a political movement whose worldview is entirely absent from the governing document of the state's most important financial institution.</p>
<h4>The Proxy Voting Battlefield: A Policy of Delegation Under Pressure</h4>
<p>The PERSI Board has a policy to &quot;allow full delegation of proxy voting to our investment managers or custodian.&quot; While a common practice, this creates a significant vulnerability. It places voting responsibility in the hands of external asset managers who use mainstream proxy advisors like ISS and Glass Lewis—the very firms targeted by the anti-ESG movement. This outsources the conflict, creating a future scenario where PERSI will be caught between its managers' global voting guidelines and the political agenda of the Idaho Treasurer and Attorney General.</p>
<h3>V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in Idaho has weaponized the concept of fiduciary duty itself, transforming it from a shield for beneficiaries into a sword for a political agenda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Fiduciaries 'shall discharge their duties with respect to the fund <strong>solely in the interest of the members and their beneficiaries</strong>' and for the '<strong>exclusive purpose of providing benefits</strong>.'&quot;</p>
<p>— Idaho Code § 59-1301</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The public justifications for anti-ESG actions are explicitly political (combating &quot;woke efforts,&quot; protecting &quot;rights and freedoms&quot;). This introduction of a collateral political purpose creates a prima facie conflict with the strict &quot;solely in the interest&quot; and &quot;exclusive purpose&quot; rules mandated by Idaho law. SB 1405 further creates a &quot;fiduciary trap&quot;: by legally framing ESG as an external force acting against the prudent investor rule, it creates a legal presumption that ESG factors are inherently suspect. A trustee who prudently considers a material climate risk could now be accused of violating the statute by letting a &quot;social&quot; factor &quot;override&quot; their duty. The path of least legal resistance becomes to ignore the risk, thereby inverting the law's protective purpose.</p>
