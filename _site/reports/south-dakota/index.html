<h3>I. The Mount Rushmore Front</h3>
<p>South Dakota presents a significant paradox in the national anti-ESG campaign. While its State Treasurer is a deeply integrated and active participant in the SFOF network, the legislative and institutional objectives of the movement have been consistently and decisively thwarted. The state serves as a crucial case study on the limits of SFOF's influence, revealing a landscape where the political activism of a key state official has created a profound conflict with the state's existing fiduciary laws and the apolitical governance of its public pension system.</p>
<h3>II. Key Actors: An Incomplete Front</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in South Dakota is driven almost exclusively by the State Treasurer, lacking the unified &quot;whole-of-government&quot; approach seen in other states.</p>

<h3>III. The Campaign in Action: A Story of Legislative Stalemate</h3>
<h4>A Legislative Firewall</h4>
<p>The most unique feature of the South Dakota case is the consistent and decisive failure of anti-ESG legislation. Despite a Republican-controlled legislature and the strong advocacy of the Treasurer, a series of bills based on national ALEC/Heritage models have been defeated in committee between 2022 and 2024, often by large, bipartisan margins. Bills like <strong>SB 182 (2022)</strong>, <strong>HB 1207 (2023)</strong>, and <strong>HB 1247 (2024)</strong> were all rejected. This pattern points to a powerful institutional firewall, likely a coalition of the state's banking and business lobbies combined with a more moderate brand of fiscal conservatism in the legislature.</p>
<h3>IV. Impact on the South Dakota Retirement System (SDRS)</h3>
<p>Despite the Treasurer's political campaign, the South Dakota Retirement System (SDRS) and its managing body, the South Dakota Investment Council (SDIC), have remained institutionally insulated from the SFOF agenda.</p>
<h4>An Apolitical Framework</h4>
<p>The SDIC's Investment Policy Statement is grounded in the traditional &quot;prudent person standard&quot; and is entirely devoid of the politically charged terms &quot;ESG&quot; or &quot;pecuniary factors.&quot; The legislative firewall has left this professional investment framework intact. Furthermore, an analysis of the SDRS portfolio reveals no direct holdings in Israel Bonds, a signature politically motivated investment promoted by the SFOF network, underscoring the system's independence.</p>
<h3>V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis</h3>
<p>The Treasurer's political activism appears to be in direct conflict with the plain language of South Dakota's fiduciary statutes, particularly a unique and powerful pre-existing prohibition against &quot;social investment.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The assets of the system <strong>may not be managed in any manner for the purposes of social investment</strong>. The State Investment Council shall invest member trust funds in a manner that is <strong>solely designed to provide for the exclusive benefit of the members</strong>...&quot;</p>
<p>— South Dakota Codified Law § 3-12C-223</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statute creates a direct conflict for the Treasurer. SFOF's mission is fundamentally social and political (combating &quot;woke capitalism&quot;). By using his state office to advance this mission, the Treasurer introduces a collateral political purpose into his official actions, creating a prima facie conflict with the state's uncompromising &quot;no social investment&quot; and &quot;exclusive benefit&quot; mandates. This law is a double-edged sword: while it could be used to attack pro-ESG considerations, it could just as easily be used to challenge a politically motivated campaign to ignore material risks for ideological reasons.</p>
