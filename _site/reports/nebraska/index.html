<h3>I. The Architecture of Influence</h3>
<p>Nebraska presents a uniquely nuanced case study of the SFOF network's influence. Despite the failure to pass signature anti-ESG legislation, the movement achieved a significant partial capture of the state's financial governance. This was accomplished through a coordinated pressure campaign led by top state officials deeply integrated into the SFOF network, culminating in a pivotal administrative shift in the state's proxy voting policy and the placement of a key anti-ESG operative at the head of the state's retirement agency.</p>
<h3>II. Key Actors: A Leadership Hub</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in Nebraska was driven by a coordinated front of executive officials, with the state serving as a national leadership hub for the movement.</p>

<h3>III. The Campaign in Action: Administrative Success, Legislative Defeat</h3>
<h4>A Legislative Firewall</h4>
<p>The centerpiece of the SFOF/ALEC legislative agenda, a bill to legally redefine fiduciary duty (<strong>Legislative Bill 743</strong>), failed to pass. Despite strong backing from the Treasurer and Attorney General, the bill was &quot;indefinitely postponed&quot; in April 2024. This failure suggests Nebraska's unique nonpartisan, unicameral legislature is more resistant to hyper-partisan, nationally-driven model legislation than other states.</p>
<h4>The Divestment Playbook: A Warning Shot</h4>
<p>While a full divestment was avoided, the Nebraska Investment Council (NIC) took tangible action in early 2023, voting to transfer half of the state's <strong>$7.3 billion</strong> in passive index fund investments from BlackRock to Northern Trust. This move represented a political compromise, allowing the council to send a clear signal to appease anti-ESG proponents while avoiding the higher costs of a full divestment.</p>
<h3>IV. The Pension Fund Transformed: Reshaping the NIC</h3>
<p>While the legislative effort failed, the anti-ESG campaign had a direct and lasting impact on the governance and policies of the Nebraska Investment Council (NIC).</p>
<h4>The Revolving Door: Institutionalizing Influence</h4>
<p>In a move of immense strategic significance, former Treasurer and SFOF National Chair <strong>John Murante</strong> stepped down in October 2023 to become the Director of the Nebraska Public Employees Retirement Systems (NPERS). This appointment placed the former national leader of the anti-ESG movement in a permanent, high-level administrative role directly overseeing the state's pension system and sitting as an ex-officio member on the very council he previously pressured as Treasurer.</p>
<h4>The Proxy Voting Battlefield</h4>
<p>Having failed to pass LB 743, the movement achieved a core goal through direct administrative pressure. In September 2023, the NIC voted to replace its existing proxy voting policy. The new policy mandates that the state's proxy advisor must use a policy approved by the council containing <strong>&quot;only those factors that relate to enhancing or protecting the long-term economic value of each investment.&quot;</strong> This administrative victory accomplished one of the central goals of the failed legislation.</p>
<h3>V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in Nebraska weaponized a pre-existing clause in the state's controlling statute to advance its agenda, creating a conflict with the broader principles of fiduciary duty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No assets... shall be invested or reinvested if the <strong>sole or primary investment objective is for economic development or social purposes</strong> or objectives.&quot;</p>
<p>— Nebraska Revised Statute § 72-1239.01</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The campaign's core legal strategy has been to argue that any consideration of ESG factors constitutes a prohibited &quot;social purpose&quot; under this statute, regardless of its connection to financial risk or return. This interpretation creates a &quot;fiduciary trap.&quot; If NIC members consider a long-term climate risk that they prudently believe is financially material, they risk being accused by the Attorney General of violating the &quot;no social purpose&quot; clause. The path of least political resistance is to ignore such factors, which may itself be a breach of their broader duty of prudence to consider all material risks.</p>
