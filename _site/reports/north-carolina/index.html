<h3>I. The Architecture of Influence</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in North Carolina represents a textbook execution of the SFOF playbook, successfully weaponizing the concept of fiduciary duty to codify a political ideology into state law. During his tenure from 2017-2025, former State Treasurer <strong>Dale Folwell</strong>, a Republican with deep ties to both SFOF and ALEC, served as the primary conduit for this agenda. He was one of the movement's most active and high-profile operatives, positioning North Carolina as a key battleground for the implementation of the national strategy.</p>
<p>However, the North Carolina story presents a unique and unexpected evolution. The election of a new, unaffiliated State Treasurer in 2024, <strong>Brad Briner</strong>, marked a significant political discontinuity, creating a complex and evolving narrative of both successful political capture and subsequent structural resistance.</p>
<h3>II. Key Actors &amp; A Contested Landscape</h3>
<p>The campaign was driven by the Treasurer's office and legislative allies, but faced consistent opposition from the state's Democratic executive branch.</p>

<h3>III. The Campaign in Action: From Rhetoric to Law</h3>
<h4>Legislative Capture: The Passage of House Bill 750</h4>
<p>The ultimate goal of the campaign was achieved in 2023 with the passage of <strong>House Bill 750 (Session Law 2023-64)</strong>. The bill's core provision amended state law to mandate that all investment decisions for state funds be based &quot;only on pecuniary factors.&quot; The language was a near-verbatim adoption of The Heritage Foundation's model &quot;State Pension Fiduciary Duty Act.&quot; The Republican-controlled General Assembly successfully overrode a veto from Democratic Governor Roy Cooper, demonstrating their ability to enact the anti-ESG agenda even in a divided government.</p>
<h4>A Governance Revolution: The 2025 Investment Modernization Act</h4>
<p>In a major, unexpected break from the SFOF playbook, new Treasurer Brad Briner championed legislation in June 2025 to dismantle the very &quot;sole fiduciary&quot; model that had concentrated all investment authority in his office. The new law, <strong>House Bill 506</strong>, creates a new, independent North Carolina Investment Authority (NCIA) governed by a five-member, politically balanced board of investment professionals. This move, voluntarily initiated by the new Treasurer to relinquish his own power, represents a profound structural shift away from the model SFOF has historically sought to empower.</p>
<h3>IV. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign's primary legal achievement was the successful amendment of state law (G.S. 147-69.7) through HB 750. This fundamentally altered the legal definition of fiduciary duty by hard-coding the SFOF network's ideology directly into the law, resolving the conflict between political action and legal duty by legislatively redefining the duty itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The State Treasurer... Shall, in the evaluation of an investment... <strong>consider only pecuniary factors</strong>... Environmental or social considerations are pecuniary factors <strong>only if</strong> they present economic risks or opportunities that qualified investment professionals would treat as material economic considerations...&quot;</p>
<p>— N.C. General Statute § 147-69.7 (Post-HB 750)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This new language creates a &quot;fiduciary trap.&quot; While appearing to allow for some consideration of ESG risks, its political intent was to create a high legal hurdle and a significant &quot;chilling effect.&quot; It shifts the legal presumption, framing ESG factors as inherently non-pecuniary unless a fiduciary can affirmatively prove they meet a narrow economic standard. This transforms a broad principle of professional judgment into a narrow, prescriptive code of conduct, forcing fiduciaries to self-censor for fear of political reprisal.</p>
