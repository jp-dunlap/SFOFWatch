<h3>I. The Mountain State Blueprint</h3>
<p>West Virginia serves as a quintessential &quot;blueprint&quot; state for the SFOF network. The anti-ESG campaign was not the result of isolated policy decisions but the direct outcome of a coordinated alignment between the State Treasurer's Office and the national SFOF network. Under the leadership of a key SFOF operative, West Virginia was positioned as a national vanguard, pioneering the legislative and administrative tactics—including creating one of the nation's first statutory blacklists of financial firms—that would be replicated across the country. This campaign culminated in the legislative redefinition of fiduciary duty itself.</p>
<h3>II. Key Actors: A National Vanguard</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in West Virginia was established and driven by the State Treasurer's office, which functioned as a policy laboratory and national model for the SFOF network.</p>

<h3>III. The Campaign in Action: From Rhetoric to Law</h3>
<h4>The Blacklist: Senate Bill 262</h4>
<p>The centerpiece of the campaign is <strong>Senate Bill 262 (2022)</strong>, a direct implementation of ALEC's model &quot;Eliminate Political Boycotts Act.&quot; The law authorizes the State Treasurer to maintain a &quot;Restricted Financial Institution List&quot; of firms that &quot;boycott energy companies.&quot; The first list, published in July 2022, targeted five of the nation's largest banks, including BlackRock and JPMorgan Chase. The law's definition of &quot;boycott&quot; is key: it includes any firm that commits to meet environmental standards &quot;beyond applicable federal and state law,&quot; effectively targeting corporate climate commitments themselves.</p>
<h4>Codifying Ideology: House Bill 2862</h4>
<p>The campaign also reshaped the internal governance of the state's investment funds with the passage of <strong>House Bill 2862 (2023)</strong>. The law, based on The Heritage Foundation's model, mandates that all shareholder votes be cast &quot;solely in the pecuniary interests of the beneficiaries, based on a consideration of only pecuniary factors.&quot; This legislatively redefined fiduciary duty to align with the SFOF network's ideology.</p>
<h3>IV. Impact on the West Virginia Investment Management Board (WVIMB)</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign has had direct and tangible effects on the governance of the WVIMB, the independent entity responsible for investing the state's pension assets.</p>
<h4>Institutional Capture of Policy</h4>
<p>The most concrete evidence of success is the WVIMB's own Investment Policy Statement (IPS). The updated IPS now explicitly incorporates the new legal reality, stating that all proxy voting decisions will be made &quot;in the pecuniary interests of plan beneficiaries based on a consideration of only pecuniary factors.&quot; The political agenda is no longer just an external legal constraint; it has been formally adopted and internalized as the official governing policy of the institution itself.</p>
<h3>V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in West Virginia resolved the conflict between political action and legal duty by legislatively redefining the duty itself. The new laws place the state's traditional fiduciary standard, the Uniform Prudent Investor Act, in direct tension with a new, politically motivated framework.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A trustee shall invest and manage the trust assets <strong>solely in the interest of the beneficiaries</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>— West Virginia Code §44-6C-5 (Uniform Prudent Investor Act)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new laws create a &quot;fiduciary trap.&quot; Under the traditional rule, a fiduciary could be sued for failing to consider a material risk, like climate change. Under the new laws, a fiduciary is now more likely to be sued for considering that same risk if an opponent can frame it as a &quot;non-pecuniary&quot; goal. The anti-ESG statutes may compel fiduciaries to act imprudently to avoid political reprisal, inverting the purpose of fiduciary law from a shield that protects beneficiaries into a sword that enforces a political agenda.</p>
