<h3>I. The Architecture of Influence</h3>
<p>As a major industrial state with deep ties to the fossil fuel and manufacturing sectors, Ohio represents a crucial battleground for the anti-ESG movement. The state's Republican-controlled government created a fertile environment for the SFOF agenda to flourish. The campaign in Ohio was the direct outcome of a coordinated alignment between the state's most powerful financial and legal officers and the national SFOF network. This &quot;whole-of-government&quot; approach culminated in the successful legislative redefinition of fiduciary duty itself, creating a profound conflict between partisan ideology and the duties owed to the beneficiaries of the state's public pension funds.</p>
<h3>II. Key Actors: A Coordinated Executive Front</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in Ohio was executed through the parallel and mutually reinforcing actions of the state's top financial and legal officers, creating a powerful &quot;pincer movement&quot; of financial and legal pressure.</p>

<h3>III. The Campaign in Action: From Fiat to Law</h3>
<h4>Legislative Capture: The Enactment of Senate Bill 6</h4>
<p>The ultimate goal of the campaign was achieved with the 2025 passage of <strong>Senate Bill 6</strong>. The law directly amended the Ohio Revised Code to redefine fiduciary duty for the state's five public pension funds. Its language is a direct adoption of The Heritage Foundation's model &quot;State Pension Fiduciary Duty Act.&quot; The law now mandates that pension boards &quot;shall make investment decisions with the sole purpose of maximizing the return on its investments&quot; and explicitly prohibits them from making decisions &quot;with the primary purpose of influencing any social or environmental policy.&quot;</p>
<h4>Portfolio Politics: The Case of Israel Bonds</h4>
<p>The Ohio Treasury's large and growing investment in Israel Bonds, totaling <strong>$262.5 million</strong>, exemplifies the politicization of public funds. The Development Corporation for Israel, which underwrites these bonds, is a documented corporate sponsor of SFOF. Treasurer Sprague has offered an explicit dual-purpose justification for the investment, calling it a &quot;sound investment&quot; while also emphasizing the need to &quot;support our allies in Israel.&quot;</p>
<h3>IV. Impact on OPERS and STRS Ohio</h3>
<p>The political and legislative campaign has had a direct impact on the governance of Ohio's two largest public pension funds, the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS) and the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio (STRS Ohio).</p>
<h4>Subversion of Investment Policy by Statute</h4>
<p>The traditional, apolitical Investment Policy Statements of both OPERS and STRS Ohio have been legally superseded by the new, restrictive language inserted into the Ohio Revised Code by Senate Bill 6. State law now dictates investment philosophy, stripping the boards of their professional discretion to consider all material risks and opportunities.</p>
<h4>A Focus on Rules, Not Players</h4>
<p>A notable feature of the Ohio campaign is the absence of a high-profile, punitive divestment from BlackRock. Ohio's pension funds maintain significant relationships with the asset manager. This indicates a strategic choice by Ohio's anti-ESG proponents to focus on changing the <strong>rules of the game</strong> (the legal definition of fiduciary duty) rather than just punishing a single player. This approach is arguably more effective, as it embeds the anti-ESG ideology into the legal DNA of the state's investment apparatus.</p>
<h3>V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in Ohio resolved the conflict between political action and legal duty by legislatively redefining the duty itself to align with a partisan agenda. The amendment to the Ohio Revised Code represents the campaign's most significant and lasting victory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The board...shall make investment decisions with the <strong>sole purpose of maximizing the return on its investments</strong>... [and] shall not make an investment decision with the primary purpose of influencing any social or environmental policy...&quot;</p>
<p>— Ohio Revised Code § 145.11 (Post-SB 6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This new law creates the ultimate &quot;fiduciary trap.&quot; It transforms what was a broad, flexible standard of professional judgment (the &quot;prudent person&quot; rule) into a narrow, rigid, and ideological one. Any future trustee who attempts to consider a factor like long-term climate transition risk—even if they prudently believe it is financially material—now faces the legal risk of being accused of violating the state's newly defined fiduciary duty. The law does not merely guide fiduciaries; it coerces them into adopting a specific political worldview by codifying it as the sole definition of prudence.</p>
