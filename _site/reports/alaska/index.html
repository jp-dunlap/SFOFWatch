<h3>I. The Architecture of Influence</h3>
<p>Alaska represents a primary target for the SFOF network due to its deep fossil fuel dependency and its control of the Alaska Permanent Fund, one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds. The anti-ESG campaign in Alaska is characterized by a dynamic of &quot;incomplete capture&quot;: while the SFOF network has achieved significant, high-level penetration within the state's executive branch, its campaign to codify its ideology into law has been consistently thwarted by the state legislature.</p>
<p>This has created a profound and unresolved conflict between the political objectives of key appointed officials and the established fiduciary laws designed to protect the integrity of Alaska's public trusts, including the Permanent Fund and the Alaska Retirement Management Board (ARMB).</p>
<h3>II. Key Actors &amp; Coordinated Executive Front</h3>
<p>The SFOF network's influence in Alaska is structural and extends to the highest levels of state government, with Governor Mike Dunleavy's administration consistently appointing officials with deep ties to the SFOF network to the state's most powerful financial and legal positions.</p>

<h3>III. The Anti-ESG Campaign in Action</h3>
<h4>The Rhetorical Campaign: Co-opting &quot;Sustainability&quot;</h4>
<p>The Dunleavy administration has engaged in a sophisticated public relations effort to counter the mainstream ESG narrative by co-opting its language. The &quot;Inaugural Alaska Sustainability Report&quot; is a key example, arguing that &quot;sustainability&quot; is achieved <em>through</em> responsible resource development, which funds state services and benefits all Alaskans. This narrative attempts to reframe fossil fuel extraction as a social good, providing political cover for the industry.</p>
<h4>Legislative Stalemate: A Firewall Against the SFOF Blueprint</h4>
<p>Despite the executive branch's strong alignment with SFOF, the legislative campaign to codify the anti-ESG agenda has been a consistent failure. This represents a significant divergence from the blueprint seen in states like Texas. Multiple bills mirroring the Heritage Foundation's model &quot;State Pension Fiduciary Duty Act&quot; have been introduced but have consistently failed to pass.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>House Bill 174 (2023-2024):</strong> The primary legislative vehicle for the movement, it sought to prohibit fiduciaries from taking any action &quot;for the purpose of furthering a social, political, or ideological interest.&quot; The bill died in the House Finance committee.</li>
<li><strong>House Bill 303 (2023-2024):</strong> A similar bill that aimed to impose a strict &quot;pecuniary interest&quot; standard on the APFC and ARMB. It died in committee without receiving a single hearing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This legislative blockade suggests a powerful counter-pressure, possibly from a legislature wary of the unintended economic consequences seen in other states that passed similar laws.</p>
<h3>IV. Impact on Alaska's Public Funds (APFC &amp; ARMB)</h3>
<p>The state's two largest funds, the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation (APFC) and the Alaska Retirement Management Board (ARMB), have demonstrated significant institutional resilience to political pressure, rooted in their independent governance and the failure of anti-ESG legislation.</p>
<h4>A Bulwark of Apolitical Prudence</h4>
<p>The foundational Investment Policy Statements of both the APFC and ARMB are grounded in the traditional, apolitical &quot;prudent-investor rule&quot; as defined by state law. Their governing documents contain a complete absence of the politically charged terms &quot;ESG,&quot; &quot;pecuniary factors,&quot; or other language characteristic of the SFOF agenda. This demonstrates a clear institutional resistance to adopting the political lexicon of their critics.</p>
<h4>The Proxy Voting Battlefield: A Public Divergence</h4>
<p>In a highly significant move, the ARMB awarded its proxy services contract in early 2024 to <strong>Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS)</strong>. ISS is the dominant mainstream proxy advisory firm and a primary antagonist in the SFOF narrative. This decision represents an active and public affirmation of the board's institutional independence, standing in stark contrast to states like Arkansas where political pressure led to the hiring of a niche, anti-ESG firm.</p>
<h3>V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis</h3>
<p>The SFOF-aligned political campaign has created a significant legal conflict with the controlling fiduciary statutes in Alaska. The state's existing laws provide a robust defense against the SFOF agenda, which is precisely why the legislative campaign to change those laws has been so critical to the movement's long-term goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A fiduciary shall apply the prudent investor rule and exercise the fiduciary duty in the <strong>sole financial best interest of the fund</strong> entrusted to the fiduciary.&quot;</p>
<p>— Alaska Statute 37.10.071</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The explicit political justifications offered by officials for their actions—such as Governor Dunleavy's proposal to blacklist banks to protect the oil industry—present a potential conflict with the uncompromising &quot;sole interest&quot; rule. These public statements provide prima facie evidence of a &quot;dual purpose&quot; that is inconsistent with the strict duty of loyalty required by Alaska law. The failure of the anti-ESG bills to pass has preserved the traditional, flexible &quot;prudent investor&quot; standard, leaving the APFC and ARMB boards with the legal discretion and obligation to consider all financially material risks, regardless of their source.</p>
