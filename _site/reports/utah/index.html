<h3>I. The Architecture of Influence</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in Utah is a direct implementation of the national SFOF strategy, with State Treasurer Marlo Oaks serving not just as a member, but as a key national leader and architect of the movement. His high-level involvement, including his role as SFOF National Chair, means his actions as Treasurer are a direct extension of a broader, centrally-directed political campaign. This alignment has had a tangible impact on the state's largest public fund, the Utah Retirement Systems (URS), raising significant questions about the conflict between the Treasurer's political activism and his statutory fiduciary obligations.</p>
<h3>II. Key Actors: A National Leader in a State Office</h3>

<h3>III. The Campaign in Action: From Pressure to Policy</h3>
<h4>The War by Letter: Targeting S&amp;P Global</h4>
<p>A prominent example of the SFOF playbook was the April 2022 letter targeting S&amp;P Global. Treasurer Oaks coordinated a letter signed by Utah's entire federal and state Republican leadership demanding that the ratings agency withdraw its new ESG credit indicators for states. SFOF later claimed credit for helping with the national news coverage, demonstrating a clear link between the state action and the national network's public relations strategy.</p>
<h4>The BlackRock Divestment</h4>
<p>In September 2022, Treasurer Oaks announced his office had pulled approximately <strong>$100 million</strong> in state funds from BlackRock, part of a coordinated wave of similar divestments by SFOF-aligned states. The action was explicitly framed as a protest against the firm's ESG advocacy, suggesting the primary goal was not financial optimization but to send a political message.</p>
<h4>The Legislative Front</h4>
<p>Treasurer Oaks's public pressure campaigns created a receptive political environment for the passage of several anti-ESG bills in 2023. These laws, based on national models, prohibit economic boycotts and uphold a &quot;traditional understanding of fiduciary standards,&quot; successfully embedding the SFOF agenda into Utah state law.</p>
<h3>IV. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis</h3>
<p>The Treasurer's actions create a significant and unresolved tension with his legal obligations under Utah law. The state's strict &quot;sole purpose&quot; fiduciary standard is at odds with a course of action that appears to prioritize the political goals of a national advocacy network.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[The URS board shall] in accordance with the board's fiduciary responsibilities, make investment decisions with the <strong>sole purpose of maximizing the risk-adjusted return on the investments</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>— Utah Code § 49-11-203(1)(q)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Utah's &quot;sole purpose&quot; language is a stricter standard than in many other states. It creates a high legal bar that makes any investment decision with a dual purpose—for example, one that aims to maximize returns AND send a political message—particularly vulnerable to legal challenge. The key legal question is not whether ESG factors are &quot;pecuniary,&quot; but whether an action like divesting from BlackRock was done for the sole purpose of maximizing returns, or if it also served the purpose of advancing the SFOF political agenda. The Treasurer's leadership role in SFOF creates a fundamental and potentially legally actionable conflict with his fiduciary duty to act only in the interest of Utah's pensioners.</p>
