<h3>I. The Architecture of Influence</h3>
<p>The campaign to oppose ESG in Texas was not a spontaneous policy development but the systematic implementation of a national strategy orchestrated by the SFOF network. This network leveraged its deep connections within the Texas executive branch to transform the state into a primary battleground and a model for the rest of the country. The coordinated actions of the Comptroller, Governor, and Attorney General reveal a unified political front that effectively captured the state's financial and legal machinery to serve a national ideological agenda. This &quot;whole-of-government&quot; approach created a powerful and self-reinforcing apparatus for executing the SFOF playbook.</p>
<h3>II. The Executive Triumvirate</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign was advanced through the complementary actions of the state's top financial, legal, and executive officers, creating a multi-front assault on ESG principles.</p>

<h3>III. The Anti-ESG Campaign in Action</h3>
<h4>Codifying the Agenda: The Anti-Boycott Laws</h4>
<p>The legal bedrock of the campaign is a pair of 2021 laws based directly on model policies from the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Senate Bill 13 (Fossil Fuels):</strong> Prohibits state entities from contracting with or investing in companies found to &quot;boycott energy companies.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Senate Bill 19 (Firearms):</strong> Applies a nearly identical legal framework to protect the firearms industry from so-called &quot;discrimination.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Comptroller's List: A Tool of Coercive Diplomacy</h4>
<p>SB 13 mandated the Comptroller to create and maintain a blacklist of financial companies. The methodology targeted firms not just on business actions, but on their public statements and commitments to climate initiatives like Climate Action 100+. The listing of BlackRock in 2022 and its subsequent removal in June 2025—after the firm publicly retreated from these initiatives—exposes the list's true function: a lever to compel behavioral change and control corporate speech on a national scale.</p>
<h3>IV. Ripple Effect on Pension Funds (TRS &amp; ERS)</h3>
<p>The campaign has had a direct impact on the governance of the Teacher Retirement System of Texas (TRS) and the Employees Retirement System of Texas (ERS).</p>
<h4>Divergent Policy Responses</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Teacher Retirement System (TRS):</strong> The TRS Investment Policy creates a direct conflict, stating it &quot;will consider Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors that are material to long-term returns,&quot; even while being forced to comply with divestment mandates.</li>
<li><strong>Employees Retirement System (ERS):</strong> The ERS Investment Policy directly embraces the political mandate, stating &quot;Investment decisions must not be used to further social, political, or ideological interests.&quot; ERS has even switched to a custom benchmark to automatically exclude companies on the state's various blacklists.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Proxy Voting Battlefield: SB 2337</h4>
<p>Rather than forcing pension funds to fire mainstream proxy advisors like ISS, Texas pursued a &quot;disrupt and deter&quot; strategy with <strong>Senate Bill 2337</strong>. The law requires advisors to make a &quot;conspicuous disclosure&quot; if their advice is based on &quot;nonfinancial&quot; factors like ESG. This creates a legal minefield intended to intimidate advisors into moderating their ESG-related analysis for all Texas-based companies, creating a powerful chilling effect.</p>
<h4>Portfolio Politics: The Case of Israel Bonds</h4>
<p>In October 2023, Comptroller Hegar announced the Texas Treasury would purchase an additional $20 million in Israel Bonds, bringing the state's total to nearly $100 million. The justification was explicitly political as well as financial. This action, which directs public capital to an SFOF corporate sponsor, blurs the line between a financial decision and a demonstration of political solidarity, creating immense pressure on the state's pension funds to follow suit.</p>
<h3>V. A Fiduciary Duty in Conflict</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG laws create a &quot;fiduciary trap,&quot; placing the boards of TRS and ERS in a legally precarious position, caught between new state statutes and their foundational, constitutionally-mandated obligations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In making investments, a board shall exercise the judgment and care under the circumstances then prevailing that persons of ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs...&quot;</p>
<p>— Texas Constitution, Article 16, Section 67</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The requirement to divest based on political stances (fossil fuels, firearms) introduces a purpose that is not &quot;solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries,&quot; as required by Texas Government Code § 802.203. By legally defining certain factors as &quot;non-financial,&quot; the laws attempt to forbid a prudent fiduciary from considering what could be a material financial risk (e.g., climate transition risk), forcing them to act imprudently to comply with the law. The legal structure creates immense political pressure to prioritize the political mandate over an independent fiduciary analysis through political intimidation.</p>
