<h3>I. The Architecture of Influence</h3>
<p>Indiana represents a successful implementation of the national anti-ESG blueprint. The campaign was built upon a foundation of direct, operational links between the SFOF network and key officials in the state's executive branch. The Treasurer's Office and the Attorney General's Office have operated in a coordinated fashion to execute a national playbook, positioning Indiana as an active and important outpost for the movement. This &quot;whole-of-government&quot; approach culminated in the successful legislative redefinition of fiduciary duty itself, creating a profound conflict with the duties owed to the beneficiaries of the Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS).</p>
<h3>II. Key Actors: A Coordinated Executive Front</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in Indiana was advanced through the complementary actions of the state's top financial and legal officers, creating a multi-front assault on ESG principles.</p>

<h3>III. The Campaign in Action: From Model to Law</h3>
<h4>Legislative Capture: The Enactment of House Bill 1008</h4>
<p>The ultimate goal of the campaign was achieved in 2023 with the passage of <strong>House Bill 1008</strong>, a comprehensive anti-ESG law. The bill's language reveals its direct lineage from the model policies of The Heritage Foundation and ALEC. The law fundamentally redefines fiduciary duty for the Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS), mandating that the board &quot;shall discharge its duties solely in the financial interest of the participants and beneficiaries&quot; and prohibiting any investment decision made &quot;with the purpose of influencing any social or environmental policy.&quot;</p>
<p>The law's power lies in its definition of an &quot;ESG commitment&quot; as an action taken with a &quot;nonfinancial purpose to further social, political, or ideological interests.&quot; This legally frames any objective other than maximizing financial return as illegitimate, a direct adoption of the principles found in The Heritage Foundation's model &quot;State Pension Fiduciary Duty Act.&quot;</p>
<h4>Administrative Action: Targeting BlackRock</h4>
<p>HB 1008 empowered the Treasurer's office to investigate service providers for making &quot;ESG commitments.&quot; This authority was swiftly used. In June 2024, Treasurer Elliott's office published a formal report concluding that BlackRock had made such a commitment, officially placing the firm on a state watchlist. This triggered a 180-day period for INPRS to act. In December 2024, the INPRS Board, which includes the Treasurer and Comptroller, unanimously voted to remove BlackRock as the manager of its global inflation-linked bond portfolio, a direct fulfillment of the campaign's objectives.</p>
<h3>IV. Impact on the Indiana Public Retirement System (INPRS)</h3>
<h4>Institutional Capture of Policy</h4>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign achieved a two-step institutional capture. First, the SFOF network, through its legislative allies, imposed a restrictive ideology on INPRS via state law. Second, this external legal mandate was then formally incorporated and internalized into the INPRS's own governing Investment Policy Statement (IPS). The IPS, revised in May 2025, now explicitly states that the investment of System assets is &quot;not an appropriate or legally permissible instrument for achieving public policy objectives&quot; and prohibits activities based on &quot;non-financial factors associated with public policy objectives.&quot; The political agenda is no longer just a legal constraint; it has become the official, adopted policy of the institution itself.</p>
<h4>Portfolio Politics: The Case of Israel Bonds</h4>
<p>The Indiana Treasury's large and growing investment in Israel Bonds, totaling $110 million as of early 2025, exemplifies the politicization of public funds. The Development Corporation for Israel, which underwrites these bonds, is a documented corporate sponsor of SFOF. Treasurer Elliott has offered an explicit dual-purpose justification for the investment, arguing it is both a &quot;good investment&quot; and a necessary tool to &quot;support our allies.&quot; This practice of directing public capital to an SFOF-affiliated entity for explicitly political reasons is a hallmark of the network's playbook and creates immense pressure on the INPRS board to make similar, politically motivated decisions.</p>
<h3>V. Legal and Fiduciary Analysis</h3>
<p>The anti-ESG campaign in Indiana resolved the potential conflict between politically motivated actions and the traditional standard of fiduciary duty by legislatively redefining the duty itself to align with a partisan agenda. The new language, now codified at IC 5-10.2-14, legally redefines fiduciary duty in Indiana to be explicitly anti-ESG.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A fiduciary... may not make an investment decision with the purpose of influencing any social or environmental policy or attempting to influence the governance of any corporation for nonfinancial purposes.&quot;</p>
<p>— Indiana Code § 5-10.2-14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This new law creates the ultimate &quot;fiduciary trap.&quot; It transforms what was a broad, flexible standard of professional judgment into a narrow, rigid, and ideological one. Any future trustee who attempts to consider a factor like long-term climate transition risk—even if they prudently believe it is financially material—now faces the legal risk of being accused of violating the state's newly defined fiduciary duty. The law does not merely guide fiduciaries; it coerces them into adopting a specific political worldview by codifying it as the sole definition of prudence.</p>
