## The Foundation: SFOF's Rise to Power

### From Obscurity to a National Force

Founded in 2012, the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF) has emerged from relative obscurity to become a pivotal player in the American conservative movement. Operating as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, SFOF brings together Republican state treasurers, auditors, and other financial officers, creating a powerful network designed to leverage the immense financial power of state governments.

While initially focused on topics like cybersecurity and debt management, the organization radically shifted its priorities at the start of the Biden administration. It has since become the spearhead for a national campaign against Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing principles.

### The Anti-ESG Crusade

This campaign, framed as a battle against **"woke capitalism,"** seeks to prohibit public pension funds and state agencies from considering factors like climate risk, corporate board diversity, or gun safety when making investment decisions. The strategy is executed through a coordinated multi-state effort to:

* **Blacklist** major financial firms.
* **Divest** state assets from their management.
* **Enact model legislation** that redefines fiduciary duty to exclude ESG considerations.

As of August 2024, SFOF counted 37 state financial officers from 28 states as members, collectively representing trillions of dollars in state assets.

### An Operational Hub

SFOF does not operate in isolation. It is the operational arm of a sophisticated and well-funded ecosystem of conservative foundations, dark money conduits, and political action hubs. This project, SFOFWatch, is dedicated to mapping and exposing this network of influence.
