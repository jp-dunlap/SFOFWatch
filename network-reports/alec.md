## ALEC: The Corporate Bill Mill for the States

### Organizational Overview

The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), founded in 1973, is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that serves as a unique and powerful bridge between corporate interests and state legislators. Its core function is to convene private, closed-door meetings where corporate lobbyists and state lawmakers (who are almost exclusively Republican) vote as equals on "model legislation." These pre-drafted bills are then taken back by the legislators to be introduced in their home states, often verbatim, providing a "pay-to-play" forum where corporations can effectively write their own laws.

### Financials

ALEC is primarily funded by its private sector members—corporations, trade associations, and conservative foundations—who pay annual dues and lucrative conference sponsorship fees in exchange for direct access to lawmakers.

### Connections to SFOF

The relationship between ALEC and SFOF is not merely a partnership; it is a deep, structural integration.

* **Interlocking Leadership:** The two organizations are "deeply entwined." ALEC CEO Lisa Nelson sits on SFOF's board of directors, and ALEC Chief Economist Jonathan Williams serves as a senior policy advisor to SFOF. This ensures seamless strategic coordination.
* **Joint Operations:** SFOF held its 2021 national meeting "in conjunction" with ALEC's own national meeting, the event where the first major anti-ESG model bill was circulated.
* **Collaborative Legislation:** SFOF CEO Derek Kreifels and ALEC's Jonathan Williams personally collaborated to draft the "State Government Employee Retirement Protection Act," a model bill designed to prohibit ESG in public pensions. SFOF has also formally endorsed ALEC's "Eliminate Political Boycotts Act."

This symbiotic relationship is highly efficient: ALEC produces the legislative weapon; SFOF provides the elite soldiers trained to deploy it.

### Broader Anti-ESG Network

ALEC is the legislative factory of the anti-ESG movement. It is the primary vehicle for translating the ideology developed by Heritage into the technical language of state law. Its "Energy Discrimination Elimination Act," introduced in 2021, was the pioneering model bill that sought to punish financial firms for divesting from fossil fuels. ALEC's meetings also serve as crucial training and indoctrination sessions for state legislators on the anti-ESG cause.
