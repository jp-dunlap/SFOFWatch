## DonorsTrust: The 'Dark-Money ATM' of the Right

### Organizational Overview

Established in 1999, DonorsTrust serves as a donor-advised fund (DAF) for philanthropists dedicated to "limited government, personal responsibility, and free enterprise". As a DAF, it allows individuals and foundations to make tax-deductible contributions and then "advise" grants to other 501(c)(3) organizations. Crucially, the original source of the funds is not required to be publicly disclosed, making it a primary vehicle for anonymous, or "dark money," giving on the right.

### Financials

DonorsTrust is a financial behemoth. Since its founding, it has facilitated approximately **$2 billion** in grants. Its 2023 tax filings reported total assets of **$1.29 billion** and total expenses of **$358 million**.

### Connections to SFOF

DonorsTrust is a key financial backer of SFOF, providing a critical channel for anonymous funding.

* **Direct Funding:** Between 2022 and 2023, DonorsTrust funneled **$405,000** to SFOF, including a $250,000 grant for "General Operations" in 2023.
* **Strategic Anonymity:** The use of DonorsTrust aligns perfectly with SFOF's own policy of opacity, as SFOF's website explicitly states, "SFOF does not discuss or disclose our donors or sponsors". This structure allows corporations and individuals to publicly support ESG while privately financing its opposition through an untraceable channel.

### Broader Anti-ESG Network

Dubbed the "dark-money ATM of the right," DonorsTrust is a central clearinghouse for funding across the conservative movement. Its 2022 grants included **$134 million** to right-wing groups, with $12.4 million going to organizations that promote climate change denial. It is a top funder of nearly every major organization in the anti-ESG campaign, including ALEC, The Heritage Foundation, and Consumers' Research.
