## Consumers' Research: From Product Watchdog to Anti-Woke Crusader

### Organizational Overview

Founded in 1929, Consumers' Research was a pioneering organization in the American consumer protection movement. However, it underwent a radical transformation in 2020 with the appointment of Will Hild as Executive Director. Under Hild, the organization has all but abandoned its original mission, rebranding itself as a frontline warrior against "woke capitalism." Its current mission is embodied by the "Consumers First Initiative," a multi-million-dollar campaign to "put corporations on notice" for prioritizing progressive causes over customers.

### Financials

The organization's finances reflect its reinvention as a political attack group. In 2022, it launched a 501(c)(4) lobbying arm, Consumers' Defense, with a reported budget of around **$8 million**, signaling a massive infusion of cash to support its aggressive new agenda.

### Connections to SFOF

Consumers' Research is not just a funder of SFOF; it is arguably its most important strategic and public-facing partner.

* **Major Funder:** It is the second-largest known funder of SFOF, granting **$617,500** between 2021 and 2023. Executive Director Will Hild has publicly claimed that Consumers' Research is SFOF's single largest donor.
* **Media and Strategy Partner:** The collaboration is deep and multifaceted. Consumers' Research sponsored an SFOF podcast that featured West Virginia Treasurer Riley Moore attacking BlackRock. Will Hild is a frequent speaker at ALEC and SFOF events, where he trains legislators on "How States Can Fight the Woke Industrial Complex" alongside leaders from The Heritage Foundation.

### Broader Anti-ESG Network

The primary role of Consumers' Research within the network is to act as the public "attack dog." It specializes in aggressive "name and shame" media campaigns targeting CEOs of major corporations—including BlackRock, Bank of America, and Coca-Cola—for their ESG policies.

This aggressive posture is directed and funded by the network led by conservative judicial activist **Leonard Leo**. Will Hild is a protégé of Leo, who serves as a formal advisor to Consumers' Research. Leo's Marble Freedom Trust is a key source of funds for the organization. In turn, Consumers' Research has paid Leo's consulting firm, CRC Advisors, nearly **$1.6 million** for "public relations" and "legal" services, cementing its role as the PR arm of Leo's broader political operation.
