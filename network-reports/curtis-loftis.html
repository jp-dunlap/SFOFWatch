<h3>Curtis Loftis (South Carolina Treasurer)</h3>
<p>SFOF member and a central figure in the "pay-to-play" allegations filed with the SEC.</p>

<h4>The BlackRock-Federated Hermes Swap</h4>
<p>In October 2022, Loftis finalized the divestment of $200 million in state funds from BlackRock, citing ESG principles.</p>

<blockquote>
    "BlackRock's focus on promoting progressive Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors" could "seriously undermine our state's economic model."
    <cite>â€” Curtis Loftis, Oct 2022</cite>
</blockquote>

<h4>The Controversy</h4>
<p>The divested funds were moved to <strong>Federated Hermes</strong>. Federated Hermes was a top-tier "Gold" sponsor of SFOF, while BlackRock was not. This action is alleged to be an illegal "pay-to-play" scheme rewarding a political ally.</p>
