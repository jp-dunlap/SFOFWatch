<div class="prose max-w-none">
    <h1>The ALEC Playbook: How Corporate Cash and Dark Money Fuel the War on ESG</h1>

    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>A coordinated, nationwide legislative assault on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles is reshaping the landscape of American finance and corporate responsibility. This report reveals that this is not a spontaneous, grassroots movement but a meticulously orchestrated campaign engineered by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). For five decades, ALEC has operated as a powerful and secretive "corporate bill mill," connecting state legislators with corporate lobbyists to draft and disseminate model legislation that serves a pro-corporate, anti-regulatory agenda. The anti-ESG movement is the latest and one of the most consequential products of this machinery.</p>
    <p>This investigation details how ALEC, functioning as the legislative engine of the anti-ESG campaign, has weaponized statehouses to protect the interests of its corporate funders, particularly those in the fossil fuel industry. The campaign is financed by a sophisticated and often opaque network that includes ideologically aligned conservative foundations, direct corporate sponsorship, and "dark money" conduits like DonorsTrust, which funnels millions from anonymous donors.</p>
    <p>A central finding of this report is the symbiotic partnership between ALEC and the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF). Through shared leadership and coordinated strategy, these organizations have created a multi-pronged assault, with ALEC pushing model bills through legislatures while SFOF pressures financial institutions from the executive branch via state treasurers. This ecosystem is further supported by a constellation of think tanks, such as The Heritage Foundation and the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), which provide intellectual cover and lobbying support.</p>
    <p>The legislative weapons of this campaign are ALEC's model bills, chiefly the "Energy Discrimination Elimination Act" and the "State Government Employee Retirement Protection Act." This report provides a granular analysis of these bills, exposing how they use strategically ambiguous language to redefine fiduciary duty and create a "liability trap" for asset managers. The goal is to generate legal uncertainty and chill any corporate action on climate change and other material risks, effectively coercing inaction through the threat of litigation and loss of state contracts.</p>
    <p>Since 2021, hundreds of bills based on these models have been introduced in dozens of states. This report documents the tangible and severe consequences in states that have enacted them. Far from protecting state economies, these laws have inflicted significant economic harm. In Texas alone, ALEC-inspired legislation has resulted in an estimated $669 million in lost economic activity, the loss of over 3,000 full-time jobs, and has cost municipal bond issuers up to $532 million in additional interest payments in just eight months. Public pension funds, the supposed beneficiaries of this legislation, face potentially catastrophic losses, with one analysis projecting a $6.7 billion cost to Indiana's retirement system over a decade.</p>
    <p>This report concludes that the war on ESG is a manufactured crisis, conceived and executed by ALEC on behalf of a narrow set of industrial interests seeking to insulate themselves from market forces and prudent risk management. It is a stark illustration of how concentrated corporate power, amplified by dark money, can subvert democratic processes to advance a private agenda at the public's expense, posing a significant threat not only to sustainable finance but to the principles of free markets and accountable government.</p>

    <h2>I. Introduction: The Ghostwriters of State Law</h2>
    <p>Across the United States, a seemingly organic wave of legislative activity has risen to challenge the principles of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing. State lawmakers have introduced hundreds of bills aimed at punishing financial firms that consider climate risk, restricting the investment authority of public pension funds, and framing responsible corporate governance as a form of "woke capitalism" run amok. This legislative push is presented as a defense of taxpayers, retirees, and vital state industries against a politically motivated financial elite. However, this narrative obscures a deeper reality. The bills appearing in statehouses from Florida to North Dakota are not the independent work of local legislators responding to constituent concerns; they are, in large part, the products of a single, powerful, and largely invisible organization: the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).</p>
    <p>For half a century, ALEC has operated as a conduit for corporate influence in state legislatures, functioning as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) "charity" while serving as one of the most effective lobbying operations in the country. It provides a forum where corporate representatives and conservative state legislators collaborate behind closed doors to draft "model legislation" on a vast array of issues, from loosening environmental regulations and weakening labor unions to tightening voter identification rules. These pre-packaged bills are then carried back to state capitols by ALEC's legislative members and introduced, often verbatim, as their own work. This process, which has successfully placed approximately 200 model bills into law each year, effectively allows corporate interests to ghostwrite the laws that govern them.</p>
    <p>The anti-ESG campaign is a quintessential ALEC operation, a manufactured crisis designed to serve the financial interests of its key funders. The movement's core premise—that considering long-term risks like climate change is a breach of fiduciary duty—is a deliberate reframing of prudent financial management into a partisan political act. This narrative is particularly beneficial to corporations in the fossil fuel and other extractive industries, which are most exposed to the financial risks of a global energy transition and are heavily represented within ALEC's membership and funding base. By labeling ESG as "woke," ALEC and its allies have created a culture-war bogeyman to rally political opposition against a market-driven trend that threatens their benefactors' bottom lines.</p>

    <h2>II. Anatomy of a "Corporate Bill Mill"</h2>
    <p>To understand ALEC's influence on the anti-ESG movement, one must first understand its unique and highly effective organizational structure. While registered as a 501(c)(3) public charity dedicated to "education," its primary function is that of a powerful legislative incubator, a role that has earned it the moniker of a "corporate bill mill". ALEC's operational model is designed to maximize the influence of its corporate members over the legislative process, providing them with unparalleled access to and partnership with state lawmakers.</p>
    <h3>Organizational Structure</h3>
    <p>ALEC's work is organized through nine task forces, each focused on a specific policy area such as "Health and Human Services" or "Tax and Fiscal Policy". These task forces are the core of ALEC's legislative production. They are composed of both public sector members (state legislators) and private sector members (corporate lobbyists, representatives from trade associations, and ideologically aligned think tanks). It is within these task forces that model bills are debated, amended, and ultimately approved.</p>
    <p>The <strong>Energy, Environment, and Agriculture (EEA) Task Force</strong> has been the primary vehicle for developing and advancing ALEC's anti-ESG agenda. Operating under the principle of "free-market environmentalism," the EEA Task Force develops model policies aimed at promoting fossil fuels, rolling back environmental protections, and, most recently, combating ESG-related financial risk analysis. The membership of this task force is heavily weighted with representatives from major fossil fuel companies, including ExxonMobil (historically), Koch Industries, Duke Energy, and Peabody Energy, ensuring that the industry's perspective is central to the policymaking process.</p>
    <h3>The "Pay-to-Play" Model in Action</h3>
    <p>ALEC's structure is fundamentally a "pay-to-play" operation. The financial arrangement reveals the profound power imbalance between its legislative and corporate members. While state legislators pay nominal biennial dues of just $100 ($50 per year), private sector members pay between $7,000 and $25,000 annually to join. Additional fees are required to participate in the task forces where model legislation is crafted. This funding model, where corporations and their foundations provide an estimated 98% of ALEC's revenue, ensures that corporate interests are not merely heard but are the dominant force within the organization.</p>

    <h2>III. Following the Money: The Financial Engine of the Anti-ESG Campaign</h2>
    <h3>Part A: The Dark Money Funnel - DonorsTrust</h3>
    <p>At the center of ALEC's opaque funding network is DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund that has been described as the "dark-money ATM of the conservative movement". Founded in 1999, DonorsTrust was explicitly created to "safeguard the intent of libertarian and conservative donors," ensuring their contributions will never support politically liberal causes. As a donor-advised fund, it offers a critical service to its clients: anonymity. Wealthy individuals and corporations can make large, tax-deductible contributions to DonorsTrust, and then "advise" or recommend that the fund issue grants to specific 501(c)(3) organizations like ALEC. Because the final grant comes from DonorsTrust, not the original contributor, the ultimate source of the money is shielded from public disclosure requirements.</p>
    <h3>Part B: The Network of Identifiable Funders</h3>
    <p>While DonorsTrust provides a layer of secrecy, a significant portion of ALEC's funding comes from identifiable foundations and corporations whose ideological and business interests align with ALEC's anti-regulatory agenda. A review of tax filings from 2019 to 2023 shows that ALEC raised $59.3 million, with only $4.7 million attributable to disclosed conference revenue and membership dues, leaving nearly $55 million in other revenue. Analysis by the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) has identified the sources for $19.1 million of this undisclosed revenue.</p>
    
    <h2>IV. The Anti-ESG Ecosystem: A Coordinated Assault</h2>
    <h3>Part A: The ALEC-SFOF Symbiosis</h3>
    <p>The relationship between ALEC and SFOF is not merely a casual alliance but a strategic symbiosis designed to attack ESG from both the legislative and executive branches of state government. While ALEC provides its corporate-backed model bills to state legislators, SFOF organizes Republican state treasurers and auditors from 28 states, providing them with the same pro-corporate, anti-regulatory talking points and policy goals. This creates a pincer movement against sustainable finance.</p>
    <h3>Part B: The Constellation of Influence</h3>
    <p>Beyond its core partnership with SFOF, ALEC is situated within a constellation of conservative think tanks and advocacy groups that work in concert to advance the anti-ESG campaign. These organizations provide intellectual ammunition, lobbying muscle, and public relations cover for ALEC's legislative efforts. This network effectively constitutes a division of labor for the anti-ESG movement.</p>

    <h2>V. The Playbook: Weaponizing Legislation</h2>
    <h3>Dissecting the Model Bills</h3>
    <p>Two key pieces of model legislation form the foundation of ALEC's anti-ESG playbook. Versions of these bills have been introduced in dozens of states, often with only minor modifications.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The "Boycott" Bills: Energy Discrimination Elimination Act (EDEA) and Eliminate Political Boycotts Act.</strong> These bills represent the punitive arm of ALEC's strategy. Their central purpose is to prohibit state governmental entities from entering into contracts with or investing public funds in financial companies that are deemed to be "boycotting" favored industries.</li>
        <li><strong>The "Fiduciary Duty" Bill: State Government Employee Retirement Protection Act.</strong> This bill represents the legalistic arm of the strategy, seeking to fundamentally rewrite the legal obligations of those who manage public pension funds. The model policy strengthens fiduciary rules to mandate that investment decisions for state, local, and university pensions be based solely on "pecuniary factors".</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Legislative Tracking</h3>
    <p>The dissemination of these model bills has been remarkably successful. Since 2021, the anti-ESG campaign has seen hundreds of bills introduced across the country. In 2023 alone, 165 distinct pieces of anti-ESG legislation were introduced in 37 states, with 14 of those states ultimately enacting new laws. States with Republican trifectas (control of the governorship and both legislative chambers) have been the most active, with 10 such states passing anti-ESG laws in 2025.</p>

    <h2>VI. The Architects and Operatives: Key Individuals and Corporate Interests</h2>
    <h3>ALEC Leadership</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lisa Nelson (CEO):</strong> As Chief Executive Officer since 2014, Lisa Nelson is the primary driver of ALEC's strategic vision. She has been a vocal leader in the fight against what she terms "corporate woke culture".</li>
        <li><strong>Jonathan Williams (Chief Economist & Executive Vice President of Policy):</strong> Williams is the intellectual and policy architect of ALEC's anti-ESG legislative strategy. He was a co-drafter of the State Government Employee Retirement Protection Act.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>External Influencers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Jason Isaac (Texas Public Policy Foundation):</strong> A former four-term Texas State Representative and ALEC member, Jason Isaac now directs the TPPF's "Life:Powered" initiative, a pro-fossil fuel advocacy project.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Corporate Vanguard: The EEA Task Force</h3>
    <p>The most direct evidence of corporate influence comes from the membership of the ALEC task force responsible for approving anti-ESG model bills. The Energy, Environment, and Agriculture (EEA) Task Force is where corporate lobbyists vote alongside legislators on the final language of these bills. Attendance lists from task force meetings reveal a roster dominated by the very industries the legislation is designed to protect.</p>

    <h2>VII. The Reckoning: Impact and Consequences</h2>
    <h3>Economic Blowback</h3>
    <p>The most comprehensive data on the negative consequences of anti-ESG laws comes from Texas, the first state to enact a version of ALEC's "boycott" bill. The state's 2021 laws, Senate Bill 13 (targeting firms that "boycott" fossil fuels) and Senate Bill 19 (targeting firms that "discriminate" against the firearms industry), have served as a real-world laboratory for the economic effects of this agenda.</p>
    <h3>Impact on Public Pensions</h3>
    <p>The anti-ESG campaign's claim to be protecting public pension funds is directly contradicted by fiscal analyses and performance data. By forcing fund managers to ignore material long-term risks like climate change and by restricting their choice of investment managers, these laws threaten to significantly harm the financial security of retirees.</p>

    <h2>VIII. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This investigation has traced the origins, mechanics, and consequences of the anti-Environmental, Social, and Governance movement, revealing it to be a sophisticated and well-funded influence campaign orchestrated by the American Legislative Exchange Council. By synthesizing the evidence—from the "pay-to-play" structure of its legislative task forces and its reliance on anonymous "dark money," to its coordinated network of political allies and the severe economic damage its policies have inflicted—a clear and damning portrait emerges.</p>
