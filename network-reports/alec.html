<h3>American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC)</h3>
<p>A corporate bill mill deeply integrated with SFOF, serving as the primary legislative vehicle for the anti-ESG campaign.</p>

<h4>Integration with SFOF</h4>
<ul>
    <li>ALEC CEO Lisa Nelson sits on SFOF's board of directors.</li>
    <li>They share the same primary funders (Bradley, DonorsTrust, Koch).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Role in the Network: The Legislative Mill</h4>
<p>ALEC provides the legislative templates, notably the <strong>"Eliminate Political Boycotts Act."</strong> This model bill reframes corporate risk management as a politically motivated "economic boycott," allowing state officials to punish firms by prohibiting state contracts.</p>
