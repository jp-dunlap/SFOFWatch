## The Bradley Foundation: A Venture Capital Fund for the Conservative Movement

### Organizational Overview

Established in 1942 and radically expanded in 1985, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation is one of the most influential and well-endowed conservative foundations in the United States. Co-founder Harry Bradley was a charter member of the far-right John Birch Society, and the foundation's mission has since been explicitly directed to support projects promoting "limited, competent government" and a "dynamic marketplace". It has been described as a "venture capital fund for conservative ideas," strategically investing in organizations that can advance its agenda. The board includes prominent figures like Cleta Mitchell, a key legal figure in efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and Eugene Scalia, former Secretary of Labor.

### Financials

The Bradley Foundation commands immense financial resources. As of 2023, it reported total assets of **$987 million** and had awarded over $1.3 billion in grants since 1985. Its 2023 tax filing showed total giving for the year at **$54.1 million**.

### Connections to SFOF

The Bradley Foundation is the single largest and most important known institutional funder of the State Financial Officers Foundation.

* **Direct Funding:** Tax filings reveal that the Bradley Foundation granted SFOF a total of **$750,000** in the 2022-2023 period.
* **Affiliated Funding:** The Bradley Impact Fund, the foundation's associated donor-advised fund (DAF), provided an additional **$272,813** in 2022.
* **Strategic Partnership:** The relationship is more than financial. In September 2024, Bradley Foundation President Richard Graber delivered a keynote address at SFOF's "Investing in American Energy" summit. The Bradley Impact Fund has also actively promoted SFOF to its donor network, featuring an interview with SFOF CEO Derek Kreifels where he attacked ESG as the "weaponization of capital".

### Broader Anti-ESG Network

Funding SFOF is a key part of the foundation's broader, declared war on ESG, which it identifies as a "distortion that inhibit[s] free enterprise". Its grant-making reveals a sophisticated, multi-front strategy:

* It is the largest known funder of the National Center for Public Policy Research's (NCPPR) **"Free Enterprise Project,"** a shareholder activist group, giving it $2.2 million between 2019 and 2023.
* It is a major funder of other key nodes in the network, including **ALEC ($500,000 in 2022)**, Consumers' Research, and The Heritage Foundation.

This pattern shows a calculated approach, simultaneously funding the state-level political actors (SFOF), the shareholder activists (NCPPR), the legislative drafters (ALEC), and the intellectual leaders (Heritage).
