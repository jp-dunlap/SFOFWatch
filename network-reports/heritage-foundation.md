## The Heritage Foundation: The Intellectual Engine of the Anti-ESG Campaign

### Organizational Overview

Founded in 1973, The Heritage Foundation was created to be a more nimble, politically aggressive, and media-savvy conservative think tank. It achieved national prominence during the Reagan administration, for which its "Mandate for Leadership" report served as a comprehensive policy blueprint, with approximately 60% of its 2,000 recommendations being implemented. Its mission is to formulate and promote conservative public policies. The foundation is currently led by President Dr. Kevin D. Roberts, who previously headed the fossil-fuel-funded Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF).

### Financials

The Heritage Foundation is one of the wealthiest think tanks in the world. Its 2022 tax filings show total revenue of over **$100 million** and net assets of more than **$347 million**, giving it the resources to exert influence across a wide range of policy debates.

### Connections to SFOF

Heritage acts as the ideological guide and a key strategic partner for SFOF, providing the intellectual framework and political legitimacy for its campaigns.

* **Direct Funding and Validation:** In 2022, Heritage awarded SFOF a **$100,000 "Innovation Prize"** specifically for its work fighting ESG. This was not just a grant but a public anointing, signaling to the broader conservative movement that SFOF was a critical partner.
* **Strategic Host:** In November 2022, Heritage hosted the final day of SFOF's Fall National Meeting at its prestigious Washington, D.C., headquarters. This demonstrates a relationship where Heritage functions as the movement's "Doctrine Command," convening key allies like SFOF to coordinate strategy.
* **Model Legislation:** Heritage's own model bill, the "State Pension Fiduciary Duty Act," is actively promoted by a right-wing coalition that includes SFOF.

### Broader Anti-ESG Network

Heritage is the intellectual epicenter of the anti-ESG movement. It produces a steady stream of reports and media appearances that frame ESG as a "Left's political tool." Its 501(c)(4) advocacy arm, Heritage Action for America, runs the website **esghurts.com** and actively lobbies state legislators to pass anti-ESG bills.

The anti-ESG campaign is a critical component of Heritage's most ambitious initiative: **Project 2025**. This 900-page document is a detailed playbook for a future conservative presidential administration to consolidate power and dismantle the administrative state. By attacking and dismantling ESG now, Heritage and its allies are clearing the field of private-sector obstacles that stand in the way of their radical deregulatory agenda.
