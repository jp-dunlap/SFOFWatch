## The Sarah Scaife Foundation: An Enduring Legacy of Right-Wing Philanthropy

### Organizational Overview

Established in 1941, the Sarah Scaife Foundation is one of the oldest and most consistent funders of the American conservative movement, built on the Mellon family fortune (banking, Gulf Oil, Alcoa). The foundation was transformed into a political powerhouse by Richard Mellon Scaife, who was described by the *Washington Post* as a "funding father of the right." He systematically redirected the foundation's resources to build the intellectual and institutional infrastructure of modern conservatism, a mission that continues today.

### Financials

The foundation remains a formidable financial entity. Its 2023 tax filing reported total assets of **$610 million**, with total giving for the year at **$43.5 million**.

### Connections to SFOF

The Sarah Scaife Foundation is a top-five known funder of SFOF, continuing its long tradition of supporting emerging conservative activist groups.

* **Direct Funding:** Between 2022 and 2023, the foundation granted SFOF a total of **$245,000**.
* **Specific Grant:** The foundation's 2022 annual report details a specific grant of **$125,000** to SFOF for "General operating support," confirming a direct endorsement of SFOF's core mission.

### Broader Anti-ESG Network

The Scaife Foundation's support for SFOF is a logical extension of its decades-long strategy of institutional construction on the right. It was an early and crucial benefactor of The Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society. Its 2022 grants demonstrate a continued focus on the key players in the anti-ESG movement:

* **$1.5 million** to The Heritage Foundation
* **$800,000** to the Foundation for Government Accountability
* **$475,000** to the Competitive Enterprise Institute
* **$100,000** to ALEC

Its support for a newer, more specialized group like SFOF represents an investment in the operationalization of its long-held ideas at the state level.
